# Kaggle Competition: Adapting Gemma 2 for 73 Languages

## Project Overview
With over 7,000 languages and countless cultural differences, AI has the potential to foster global understanding. In a step towards broader linguistic inclusion, we're launching a Kaggle competition focused on adapting Gemma 2, Google's open model family, for 73 eligible languages. This project aims to demonstrate the complete process of adapting Gemma 2, including dataset creation/curation, fine-tuning, and inference and evaluation.

## 1. Dataset Creation/Curation

### Data Sources
- Describe where you sourced your data (e.g., existing datasets, web scraping, user-generated content).

### Preprocessing Steps
- Document the steps taken to clean and prepare the data. Include code snippets for:
  - Tokenization
  - Language detection
  - Removal of unwanted characters or noise

### Data Quality Considerations
- Discuss any steps taken to ensure the quality of the data:
  - Handling missing values
  - Addressing cultural sensitivity issues

### Final Dataset Exploration
- Include visualizations (e.g., distribution of languages, word counts) to provide insights into your dataset.

## 2. Fine-tuning Gemma

### Model Selection
- Briefly explain why you chose Gemma 2 for fine-tuning.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Discuss your hyperparameter choices and rationale. Include a table summarizing different configurations if applicable.

### Training Procedures
- Describe your training strategy:
  - Epochs, batch size, learning rate, etc.
  - Techniques used for performance enhancement (e.g., few-shot prompting, retrieval-augmented generation).

### Training Logs and Metrics
- Document your training process with metrics (accuracy, loss) and include visualizations (e.g., training curves).

---

## 3. Inference and Evaluation

### Running Inference
- Provide code snippets to demonstrate how to use the fine-tuned model for inference.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Discuss the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance (e.g., BLEU score for translation tasks).

### Example Outputs
- Show examples of the modelâ€™s outputs with both successful and less successful predictions.

---

## 4. Cultural and Linguistic Considerations
- Discuss any specific challenges faced when adapting the model for different languages or cultural contexts.
- Address how you ensured the model's outputs are culturally sensitive and linguistically accurate.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work
- Summarize your findings and discuss potential areas for improvement or future exploration (e.g., fine-tuning for additional languages).
- Encourage others to build upon your work.

---

## 6. Appendices
- Include additional resources or references that can help others replicate your work.
