24,CHAPTER I,THE POWER OF PREJUDICE,,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
25,CHAPTER I,I,,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
26,CHAPTER I,"Themention of Cagliostro always suggests the
marvellous, the mysterious, the unknown. There is
something cabalistic in the very sound of the name
that, considering the occult phenomena performed by
the strange personality who assumed it, is curiously
appropriate. As anincognitoit is, perhaps, the most
suitable ever invented. The name fits the man like
a glove; and, recalling the mystery in which his
career was wrapped, one involuntarily wonders if it has
ever been cleared up. In a word, what was Cagliostro
really? Charlatan, adventurer, swindler, whose impostures
were finally exposed by the ever-memorable
Necklace Affair in which he was implicated? Or
“friend of humanity,” as he claimed, whose benefactions
excited the enmity of the envious, who took
advantage of his misfortunes to calumniate and ruin
him? Knave, or martyr—which?",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
27,CHAPTER I,"This question is more easily answered by saying
what Cagliostro wasnotthan what hewas. It has
been stated by competent judges—and all who have[Pg 2]studied the subject will agree with them—that there is,
perhaps, no other equally celebrated figure in modern
history whose character is so baffling to the biographer.
Documents and books relating to him abound, but they
possess little or no value. The most interesting are
frequently the most unreliable. The fact that material
so questionable should provide as many reasons for
rejecting its evidence—which is, by the way, almost
entirely hostile—as for accepting it, has induced
theosophists, spiritualists, occultists, and all who are
sympathetically drawn to the mysterious to become
his apologists. By these amiable visionaries Cagliostro
is regarded as one of the princes of occultism whose
mystical touch has revealed the arcana of the spiritual
world to the initiated, and illumined the path along
which the speculative scientist proceeds on entering
the labyrinth of the supernatural. To them the striking
contrasts with which his agitated existence was
chequered are unimpeachable witnesses in his favour,
and they stubbornly refuse to accept the unsatisfactory
and contemptuous explanation of his miracles given
by those who regard him as an impostor.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
28,CHAPTER I,"Unfortunately, greater weight is attached to police
reports than to theosophical eulogies; and something
more substantial than the enthusiasm of the occultists
is required to support their contention. However, those
who take this extravagant (I had almost said ridiculous)
view of Cagliostro may obtain what consolation they
can from the fact—which cannot be stated too emphatically—that
though it is utterly impossible to grant
their prophet the halo they would accord him, it is
equally impossible to accept the verdict of his enemies.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
29,CHAPTER I,"In reality, it is by the evil that has been said and[Pg 3]written of him that he is best known. In his own day,
with very few exceptions, those whom he charmed or
duped—as you will—by acts that in any case should
have inspired gratitude rather than contempt observed
a profound silence. When the Necklace Affair opened
its flood-gates of ridicule and calumny, his former
admirers saw him washed away with indifference. To
defend him was to risk being compromised along with
him; and, no doubt, as happens in our own times, the
pleasure of trailing in the mud one who has fallen
was too delightful to be neglected. It is from this
epoch—1785—when people were engaged in blighting
his character rather than in trying to judge it, that
nearly all the material relating to Cagliostro dates.
With only such documents, then, to hand as have
been inspired by hate, envy, or simply a love of
detraction, the difficulty of forming a correct opinion
of him is apparent.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
30,CHAPTER I,"The portrait Carlyle has drawn of Cagliostro is the
one most familiar to English readers. Now, though
Carlyle’s judgments have in the main been upheld by
the latest historians (who have had the advantage of
information to which he was denied access), nevertheless,
like everybody else, he made mistakes. In his case,
however, these mistakes were inexcusable, for they
were due, not to the lack of data, but to the strong
prejudices by which he suffered himself to be swayed
to the exclusion of that honesty and fairness he deemed
so essential to the historian. He approached Cagliostro
with a mind already biassed against him. Distasteful
at the start, the subject on closer acquaintance became
positively repugnant to him. The flagrant mendacity
of the documentary evidence—which, discount it as he[Pg 4]might, still left the truth in doubt—only served to
strengthen his prejudice. It could surely be no innocent
victim of injustice who aroused contempt so
malevolent, hatred so universal. The mystery in
which he masqueraded was alone sufficient to excite
suspicion. And yet, whispered the conscience of the
historian enraged at the mendacity of the witnesses he
consulted, what noble ideals, what lofty aspirations
misjudged, misunderstood, exposed to ridicule, pelted
with calumny, may not have sought shelter under that
mantle of mystery?",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
31,CHAPTER I,"“Looking at thy so attractively decorated private
theatre, wherein thou actedst and livedst,” he exclaims,
“what hand but itches to draw aside thy curtain;
overhaul thy paste-boards, paint-pots, paper-mantles,
stage-lamps; and turning the whole inside out, findtheein the middle thereof!”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
32,CHAPTER I,"And suiting the action to the word, he clutches with
an indignant hand at that metaphorical curtain; but
in the very act of drawing it aside his old ingrained
prejudice asserts itself. Bah! what else but a fraud
can a Grand Cophta of Egyptian Masonry be? Can
a Madame von der Recke, a Baroness d’Oberkirch,
whose opinions at least are above suspicion, be other
than right? The man is a shameless liar; and if he
has been so shamelessly lied about in turn, he has only
got what he deserved. And exasperated that such
a creature should have been permitted even for a
moment to cross the threshold of history, Carlyle
dropped the curtain his fingers “itched to draw aside”
and proceeded to empty all the vials of his wrath
on Cagliostro.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
56,CHAPTER I,"“The adventures,” he asks, “of Giuseppe Balsamo
and those of Alessandro Cagliostro—do they belong
to the history of the same career? Was the individual
who had his wife shut up in Sainte Pélagie in 1773[Pg 13]the same who in 1786 protested so vehemently against
the imprisonment of his wife?[3]",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
57,CHAPTER I,"“Everything goes to prove it. The Countess
Cagliostro was born in Rome; Balsamo’s wife was
likewise a Roman. The maiden name of both was
Feliciani.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
33,CHAPTER I,"In his brilliant essay, in theDiamond Necklace, in the[Pg 5]French Revolution—wherever he meets him—he brands
him as a “King of Liars,” a “Prince of Scoundrels,”
an “Arch-Quack,” “Count Front of Brass-Pinch-beckostrum,”
“Bubby-jock,” “a babbling, bubbling
Turkey-cock,”et cetera. But such violence defeats its
intention. When on every page the historian’s conscience
is smitten with doubts that prejudice cannot
succeed in stilling, the critical and inquisitive reader
comes to the conclusion he knows less about therealCagliostro at the end than he did at the beginning.
He has merely seen Carlyle in one of his fine literary
rages; it is all very interesting and memorable, but
by no means what he wanted. As a matter of fact, in
this instance Carlyle’s judgment is absolutely at sea;
and the modern biographers of Cagliostro do not even
refer to it.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
34,CHAPTER I,"Nevertheless, these writers have come pretty much
to the same conclusion. M. Henri d’Alméras, whose
book on Cagliostro is the best, speaking of the
questionable evidence that so incensed Carlyle,
declares “the historian, even in handling it with care,
finds himself willy-nilly adopting the old prejudice.
That is to say, every book written on Cagliostro, even
under the pretext of rehabilitating him, can only be
a bookagainsthim.” But while holding to the old
conventional opinion, he considers that “a rogue so
picturesque disarms anger, and deserves to be treated
with indulgence.” D’Alméras pictures Cagliostro as
a sort of clown, which is certainly the most curious
view ever taken of the “Front of Brass,” and even
more unjustifiable than Carlyle’s.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
35,CHAPTER I,"“What a good-natured, amusing, original rascal!”
he exclaims. “The Figaro of Alchemy, more intelligent[Pg 6]than Diafoirus, and more cunning than Scapin.
And with what imperturbable serenity did he lie in
five or six languages, as well as in a gibberish that
had no meaning at all. To lie like that gives one a
great superiority over the majority of one’s fellow-men.
He did not lie because he was afraid to speak the
truth, but because, as in the case of many another,
falsehood was in him an excessive development of the
imagination. He was himself, moreover, the first
victim of his lies. By the familiar phenomenon of
auto-suggestion, he ended by believing what he said
from force of saying it. If he was successful, in a
certain sense, he deserved to be.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
36,CHAPTER I,"From all of which it may be gathered that whether
Cagliostro is depicted as an Apostle of Light by his
friends the occultists, or a rank impostor by his enemies,
of whom Carlyle is the most implacable and d’Alméras
the most charitably inclined, the real man has been as
effectually hidden from view by prejudice as by the
mystery in which he wrapped himself. But heavy
though the curtain is that conceals him, it is perhaps
possible for the hand that “itches” to draw it aside.
As a matter of fact, no really honest attempt has ever
been made to do so. It is true it is only a fleeting,
somewhat nebulous, glimpse that can be obtained of
this singular personality. There is, moreover, one
condition to be observed. Before this glimpse can be
obtained it is essential that some attempt should be
made to discover, if possible,whoCagliostro was.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

biographical dictionaries and encyclopedias to find it
definitely asserted that “Count Cagliostro” was the
best known of manyaliasesassumed by Giuseppe
Balsamo, a Sicilian adventurer born in Palermo in
1743 or 1748, the above statement would appear to
be directly contrary to recorded fact. For though
biographical dictionaries and encyclopedias are
notoriously superficial and frequently misleading, they
are perhaps in this instance accurate enough for the
purpose of casual inquiry, which is after all what they
are compiled for. Indeed, this Balsamo legend is so
plausible an explanation of the mystery of Cagliostro’s
origin that, for lack of any other, it has satisfied all
who are entitled to be regarded as authorities. The
evidence, however, on which they have based their
belief is circumstantial rather than positive.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
40,CHAPTER I,"Now circumstantial evidence, as everybody knows,
is not always to be trusted. There are many cases on
record of persons having been condemned on the
strength of it who were afterwards found to be innocent.
In this particular case, moreover, doubtsdoexist, and all “authorities” have admitted the fact.
Those prejudiced against Cagliostro have agreed to
attach no importance to them, those prejudiced in his
favour the greatest. To the occultists they are the
rock on which their faith in him is founded. Their
opinion, however, may be ruled aside as untenable,
for the doubts are entirely of a negative character, and
suggest no counter-theory of identity whatever.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

suffered misfortune from a personal experience of his
fabulous powers, acquired European notoriety.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
44,CHAPTER I,"The excitement caused by thiscause célèbre, as is well
known, was intense and universal. The arrest of the
Cardinal in the Oeil-de-Boeuf at Versailles, in the
presence of the Court and a great concourse of people
from Paris, as he was about to celebrate mass in the
Royal Chapel on Assumption Day, on the charge of
having purchased a necklace for 1,600,000 livres for
the Queen, who denied all knowledge of the transaction;
the subsequent disappearance of the jewel
and the suspicion of intent to swindle the jeweller
which attached itself to both Queen and Cardinal; the
further implication of the Countess de Lamotte, with
her strangely romantic history; of Cagliostro, with his
mystery and magic; and of a host of other shady
persons—these were elements sensational enough to
strike the dullest imagination, fire the wildest curiosity,

45,CHAPTER I,"After the Cardinal, whose position as Grand
Almoner of France (a sort of French Archbishop of
Canterbury, so to speak) made him the protagonist of
this drama, the self-styled Count Cagliostro was the[Pg 9]figure in whom the public were most interested. The
prodigies he was said to have performed, magnified by
rumour, and his strange undecipherable personality
gave him an importance out of all proportion to the
small part he played in the famous Affair of the
Necklace. Speculation as to his origin was naturally
rife. But neither the police nor the lawyers could
throw any light on his past. The evidence of the
Countess de Lamotte, who in open court denounced
him as an impostor formerly known as Don Tiscio, a
name under which she declared he had fleeced many
people in various parts of Spain, was too palpably
untrustworthy and ridiculous to be treated seriously.
Cagliostro himself did, indeed, attempt to satisfy
curiosity, but the fantastic account he gave of his
career only served—as perhaps he intended—to deepen
its mystery.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

ridiculous pomposity on his examination, confessed
that Cagliostro was only one of the several names
he had assumed in the course of his life. Analias—he
had termed itincognito—is always suspicious.
Coupled, as it was in his case, with alchemical experiments,
prognostications, spiritualist séances, and quack
medicines, it suggested rascality. From ridicule to
calumny is but a step, and for every voice raised in
defence of his honesty there were a dozen to decry
him.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

difficulty in proving his innocence—eight or ten
thousand people cameen masseto offer him their[Pg 10]congratulations. The court-yard, the staircase, the
very rooms of his house in the Rue St. Claude were
filled with them. But this ovation, flattering though it
was to his vanity, was intended less as a mark of
respect to him than as an insult to the Queen, who was
known to regard the verdict as a stigma on her honour,
and whose waning popularity the hatred engendered
by this scandalous affair had completely obliterated.
Banished the following day by the Government,
which sought to repair the prestige of the throne
by persecuting and calumniating those who might be
deemed instrumental in shattering it, Cagliostro lost
what little credit the trial had left him.Whoever

paper published in London, that he was Giuseppe
Balsamo. This announcement, made with every
assurance of its accuracy, was at once repeated by
other journals throughout Europe. It would be
interesting, though not particularly important, to know
how theCourier de l’Europeobtained its information.
It is permissible, however, to conjecture that the
Anglo-French journal had been informed of the

51,CHAPTER I,"On December 2, 1876—dates are important factors
in the evidence—Fontaine, the chief of the Paris
police, received a very curious anonymous letter
from Palermo. The writer began by saying that he
had read in theGazette de Leydeof September 25 an
article taken from theCourier de l’Europestating that
the “famous Cagliostro was called Balsamo,” from
which he gathered that the Balsamo referred to was
the same who in 1773 had caused his wife to be shut
up in Sainte Pélagie at Paris for having deserted
him, and who had afterwards applied to the courts
for her release. To confirm Fontaine in this opinion,
he gave him in detail the history of this Balsamo’s
career, which had been imparted to him on June 2
by the said Balsamo’s uncle, Antonio Braconieri,
who was firmly convinced that his nephew, of whom
he had heard nothing for some years, was none other
than Cagliostro. As he learnt this the day after
Cagliostro’s acquittal and release from the Bastille,
the news of which could not have reached Palermo
in less than a week, it proves that Braconieri’s conviction
was formed long before the Press began to
maintain it.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
52,CHAPTER I,"In fact the anonymous writer stated that this
conviction was prevalent in Palermo as far back as
the previous year, when the news arrived there of the
arrest of Cagliostro in connection with the Diamond
Necklace Affair.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
53,CHAPTER I,"He went on to say that he had personally ridiculed[Pg 12]the report at the time, but having reflected on the
grounds that Braconieri had given him for believing
it “he had come to the conclusion that Count
Cagliostro was Giuseppe Balsamo of Palermo or that
Antonio Braconieri, his uncle, was a scoundrel worthy
of being the uncle of M. le Comte de Cagliostro.”
As it was not till November 2 that this somewhat
ingenuous person sent anonymously to Fontaine
the information he had received on June 2 from
Braconieri, his reflections on the veracity of the
latter, one suspects, were scarcely complimentary.
However, such doubts as he might still have cherished
were finally set at rest on October 31, when
Antonio Braconieri met him in one of the chief
thoroughfares of Palermo and showed him aGazette
de Florencewhich confirmed everything Braconieri
had told him more than four months before. Hereupon,
the anonymous individual, convinced at last

The fact that both were Romans is no argument at
all. Though their maiden name was Feliciani, it was
a comparatively common one—there were several
families of Feliciani in Rome, and for that matter all
over Italy. Madame Balsamo’s father came from
Calabria. Her Christian name was Lorenza. The
statement that the Countess Cagliostro was likewise
called Lorenza and changed her name to Seraphina, by
which she was known, is based entirely on supposition.
That both were married very young and that neither
knew how to write, scarcely calls for comment. Italian
women usually married in early girlhood, and very few,
if any, of the class to which Seraphina Cagliostro
and Lorenza Balsamo belonged could write.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
66,CHAPTER I,"(2) The testimony of the experts as to the remarkable
similarity between the writing of Balsamo and[Pg 15]Cagliostro requires something more than an official
statement to that effect to be convincing. At the time
the experts made their report, the French Government
were trying to silence the calumnies with which Marie
Antoinette was being attacked by making the character
of Cagliostro and others connected with the Necklace
Affair appear as bad as possible. The Parisian
police in the interest of the Monarchy, jumped at the
opportunity of identifying the mysterious Cagliostro
with the infamous Balsamo. The experts’ evidence is,
to say the least, questionable.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
67,CHAPTER I,"(3) The fact that Giuseppe Balsamo had an uncle
called Giuseppe Cagliostro is the strongest argument
in favour of the identification theory. There is no
reason to doubt Antonio Braconieri’s statement that he
had received letters from his nephew signed “Count
Cagliostro.” However, the writer of the anonymous
letter declared that, desiring to prove Braconieri’s word
as to the existence of Giuseppe Cagliostro of Messina,
he discovered that there weretwofamilies of the name
in that city. The prefix Cagli, moreover, is not
unusual in Sicilian, Calabrian and Neapolitan names.
The selection of it by Cagliostro as anincognitomay
have been accidental, or invented because of its peculiar
cabalistic suggestion as suitable for the occult career
on which he embarked, or it may have been suggested
to him by some one of the name he had met when
wandering about southern Italy. As his identification
with Balsamo is based principally on coincidence,

have been employed at one time, the fantastic account
he gave of himself at his trial should be remembered.
One of the principal reasons for disbelieving him was
the fact that these personages weredeadand so unable

goes. Unfortunately, it merely proves that both were
short, had dark complexions, and peculiarly bright
eyes. As for their noses, Braconieri described
Balsamo’s as beingécrasé; it is a much more forcible

Now Balsamo was known to have lived in London in

that, in 1773, the events occurred which brought both
prominently under the notice of the authorities. Six
years after Balsamo’s disappearance from London,
Count Cagliostro appeared in that city, and becoming
involved with a set of swindlers in a manner that made
him appear a fool rather than a knave, spent four months

“one day whilst he and his companions

to gratify him. Marking a square on the ground he
made some passes with his hands above it, after which
the figure of the girl was seen in the square playing
attressettewith three of her friends.” So great was
the effect of this exhibition of clairvoyance, thought-transference,

Giuseppe informed him under pledge of the strictest

Palermo, in which a great treasure was buried.
According to a superstition prevalent in Sicily, where
belief in such treasure was common, it was supposed
to be guarded by demons, and as it would be necessary
to hire a priest to exorcize them, Giuseppe offered to
take Marano to the spot and assist him in lifting the

in the secret. On arriving at the cave, preparatory
to the ceremony of exorcism, the priest proceeded to
evoke the demons, which was done with due solemnity
by means of magic circles and symbols drawn upon
the ground, incantations in Latin,et cetera. Suddenly
hideous noises were heard, there was a flash and
splutter of blue fire, and the air was filled with sulphur.
Marano, who was waiting in the greatest terror for
the materialization of the powers of darkness, in which
he firmly believed, and who, he had been told, on
such occasions sometimes got beyond the control of
the exorcist, was commanded to dig where he stood.
But scarcely had his spade struck the ground when
the demons themselves appeared with shrieks and
yells—some goat-herds hired for the occasion, as

from the last occasion on which he was reported to
have been seen in the flesh at Malta, only another way
of saying that he was clever in evading the police.
But as Balsamo after having “overrun the whole

Papal States they proceeded very leisurely, swindling
right and left as they went. At Loretto they obtained
“fifty sequins” from the governor of the town by means
of a forged letter of introduction from Cardinal Orsini.
In this way they got as far as Bergamo, where the
crafty Agliata decided to adopt different tactics. He
accordingly gave out that he was a recruiting agent of

adventurer. The “Marchesa” had her prince and his
purse, and what was to prove of even greater value,
his influence to draw upon. For a while, indeed, so

settling down and living on the fortune Lorenza had
plucked from her prince. He actually hired a house
on the outskirts of Palermo with this intention. But
he counted without Marano, that “ninny of a goldsmith,”

to judge by their appearance, if not of
distinction, arrived in London and engaged a suite of
furnished apartments in Whitcombe Street, Leicester
Fields. They called themselves Count and Countess
Cagliostro; and their landlady, who lost no time in
letting everybody in the house, as well as her neighbours,
know she had people of title as lodgers, added
that she believed they were Italian, though so far as
she could understand from the Count’s very broken
English they had last come from Portugal. A day or
two later she was able to inform her gossips, which no
doubt she did with even greater satisfaction, that her
foreign lodgers were not only titled but undoubtedly
rich, for the Countess had very fine jewels and the
Count was engaged in turning one of the rooms he
had rented into a laboratory, as he intended to devote
himself to the study of physics and chemistry, subjects,
it seemed, in which he was keenly interested.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

in reduced circumstances who lodged in the same[Pg 50]house. Hearing they had come from Portugal, and
being herself a native of that country, she sought their
acquaintance in the hope of deriving some personal
benefit from it. In this she was not disappointed;
for the Countess, who knew no English, required a
companion, and as Madame Blevary was conversant

ex-Jesuit and professor of languages. Like her, he
too had fallen on hard times; but in his case the love
of gambling had been his ruin. He was also, as it
happened, almost equally devoted to the study of
chemistry, on a knowledge of which he particularly
piqued himself. No sooner, therefore, did he learn
that Count Cagliostro had a similar hobby, and a
laboratory into the bargain, than he persuaded Madame
Blevary to introduce him to the Count, in the hope
that he too might profit by the acquaintance as she
had done. As a result of this introduction, Vitellini
succeeded in ingratiating himself into the favour of

assistant.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

Vitellini’s acquaintances, who in their turn were eager
to meet the benevolent foreigner. Thus by the indiscretion
of Vitellini, Cagliostro was soon besieged
by a crowd of shady people whose intentions were
so apparent that he was obliged in the end to refuse
to receive them when they called. But this only
exasperated them; and one in particular, Pergolezzi—the
painter and decorator by whom the reader will
recall Balsamo was for a time employed—“threatened

him. For Madame Blevary, who also entertained in
secret a similar opinion of her patron’s wealth and
knowledge, was one of those whose cupidity had been
excited by Vitellini’s gossip. She at least had the
advantage of being on the inner side of the Count’s

It was accordingly arranged between them that Scott
should impersonate a Scotch nobleman, in which guise

deceived as to his intentions. A severe illness, however,
with which she was suddenly seized, and during
which the Cagliostros “supplied her with every
necessary comfort,” prevented Madame Blevary from
personally introducing her confederate. Nevertheless

something more than the mere word of a single and

he had hitherto taken any particular interest, he was[Pg 55]unwilling to express an opinion as to the value of these
calculations, “having long contracted the habit of

further concern in anything of that nature.” The
manner in which these words were uttered was too
emphatic to permit Miss Fry to continue to cherish
the least hope of ever being able to induce Cagliostro
to change his mind. Still, even now she refused to
accept defeat. The numbers had become to her like
morphia to amorphineuse; and precisely as the latter
to obtain the drug she craves will resort to the most
desperate stratagems, so Miss Fry determined to

nothing more nor less than a sort of muscular blackmail.

who was the life and soul of the conspiracy, had the
help of a barrister named Reynolds, “who, notwithstanding

an action against Cagliostro to recover £190, the writ
for which was served by Reynolds, apparently by
bribing the sheriff’s officer. Thus armed, he proceeded
to Cagliostro’s house accompanied by the others, and
while he explained to the amazed Count, who had
never seen him before, the object of his visit and the
authority for what he did, Scott and Broad broke into
the laboratory, where they found and took possession
of the manuscript and the note-of-hand for the two
hundred pounds the Count had lent Miss Fry, who
during these highly criminal proceedings had the
shrewdness to “wait on the stairs” without. Reynolds
then conducted Cagliostro to a sponging-house, from[Pg 61]which he was released the following day by depositing
with Saunders, the sheriffs officer, “jewels worth three or
four hundred pounds.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

protested “he had never seen Aylett, and did not
believe Aylett had ever seen him,” or that Aylett
himself did not appear in person. As the law then
stood, Crisp’s statement was sufficient to detain the
unfortunate Count, whom he in his turn was anxious[Pg 69]to bleed while he had the chance. Accordingly,
while admitting that without Aylett’s consent he
was not empowered to accept the bail which Cagliostro
eagerly offered him, Crisp was only ready to
let him go “if he could deposit in his hand thirty
pounds to indemnify him.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

could make neither head nor tail, at once renewed
their persecution. This time they procured a warrant
for the arrest of both himself and his wife on the
charge of practisingwitchcraft. The fact that it was
possible to obtain a warrant on so ridiculous a charge,
which both those who made it, as well as the official
by whom the warrant was granted, were perfectly aware
would be dismissed with contempt the moment it was
investigated, explains how easy it was, under the
corrupt and chaotic state of the legal system of the
period, to convert the protection of the law into a
persecution. Indeed, unauthenticated though they
are, none of the legal proceedings in which Cagliostro
was now involved are improbable. On the contrary
their probability is so great as almost to guarantee
their credibility.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

being taken to jail before the investigation of the
charge on which they were apprehended. Seeing
that their victim was not to be terrified, his persecutors
tried other tactics. Reynolds was deputed
to persuade him, if possible, to explain the system
by which he predicted the winning numbers.
But Cagliostro indignantly refused to gratify him
when he called, whereupon Scott, who had remained
without the door, his ear glued to the key-hole,[Pg 62]perceiving that the eloquence of Reynolds failed to
produce the desired effect, suddenly burst into the room,

Cagliostro regarded the bully and his pistol with
contemptuous composure—particularly as he did not
discharge it. He assured him that nothing was to be
accomplished by solicitations or threats, but as he desired
to be left in peace he was ready “to think no more of

immediately went with Cagliostro to Saunders’ house
to settle the matter. But Saunders, realizing that
Cagliostro’s troubles were due to his gullibility, ignorance
of English, and apparent fortune, was tempted to
reserve the plucking of so fat a bird for himself. He
accordingly advised the Count not to compromise
the matter, but to bring in his turn an action for
robbery against the crew of sharpers into whose power
he had fallen. Cagliostro was easily induced to accept
this advice, and with the aid of Saunders procured
four warrants for the arrest of Scott, Reynolds, Broad,
and Miss Fry. The last, however, aware that the
charge against her could not be substantiated, as
she had not personally been present at the time of
the robbery, made no attempt to escape, and was[Pg 63]taken into custody—from which, as she had foreseen,
she soon freed herself. As for the other three,

fury he had to deal with in Miss Fry. The two

quashed, as she took care daily to let him know in
ways studiously calculated to render the reminder
particularly harassing. Saunders, with whom he had

more absurd is the assertion of the Editor of theCourier de l’Europe—theonlyother source of information
beside Cagliostro in regard to these proceedings—that
the Count was “constrained frompoverty” to
reside with Saunders! Even if foreigners in distress

prisoners confined there, and even paid the debts of
some, who thus obtained their freedom.” Of these,
one “Shannon, a chemist,” is quoted by him as being

this woman’s fury, it was not surprising that he should
have attributed the extraordinary circumstances that
now occurred to her vindictive ingenuity. As he was
preparing to leave the King’s Bench, “Mr. Crisp, the
under-marshal of the prison, informed him that one
Aylett had lodged a detainer against him by name of
Melisa Cagliostro, otherwise Joseph Balsamo, for a
debt of £30.” The Count demanded with the
utmost surprise the meaning of this new intrigue.
Crisp replied that Aylett declared the sum specified
was due to him as his fee, with interest added,
from “one Joseph Balsamo, by whom he had been
employed in the year 1772 to recover a debt of a
Dr. Benamore.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

out of it altogether. Left without counsel at the last
moment, Cagliostro was driven in desperation to defend
his cause himself. As his knowledge of English was
very imperfect, he was obliged to have an interpreter,
and, none other apparently being available, he employed
Vitellini. But as Vitellini, either owing to excitement
caused by the responsibility he was suddenly called
upon to assume, or to an equally imperfect knowledge
of English, could not make himself understood, Lord[Pg 65]Mansfield, to avoid further confusion, and perceiving
from the charge of witchcraft that the case was trivial,
suggested a compromise and recommended a Mr.

consent.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

he had obtained the sequins, Broad replied that he
had “bought them of a merchant whose name he
could not recollect.” At this Howarth, whose
suspicions were naturally aroused by such a reply,
observed that “it must have been a very large amount
of sequins to represent £200, and he did not believe
any merchant would have such a quantity on hand.”
Broad hereupon declared he had not bought them
of one merchant, “but of aboutfourscore.” But on

this there was nothing for Howarth to do but dismiss
the charge, which he did with “a severe reprimand.”[Pg 66]Miss Fry, however, was not to be beaten without a
further effort. She demanded that the necklace should
be returned to her, which she declared she had onlylentto the Countess. To this Cagliostro saw fit to
protest, but as Vitellini failed to express his reasons
intelligibly, Howarth came to the conclusion that the
necklace at least belonged to Miss Fry. He therefore

to pay the costs and compensate Miss Fry, he resolved
to release himself from his obligations by surrendering
the Count. Keeping his intention a profound secret,
he paid a friendly visit to Cagliostro, and at the close
carried him off for a drive in the park. “On their way,”
says an anonymous author of the only contemporary
book in defence of Cagliostro, “they alighted at
a judge’s chambers, where Mr. Badioli said he had
business to settle. They then again entered the coach,

adversity seemed no doubt futile. He accepted the
situation apathetically. More than a month elapsed
before he apparently took steps to procure his release—even
then the proceedings which resulted in his
liberation from the King’s Bench prison do not
appear to have been instituted by himself, but by a
certain O’Reilly. Now as this good Samaritan was
previously unknown to him, there is reason to suppose
that he was delegated by the Esperance Lodge of
Freemasons, of which the Count was a member, to
assist him. For O’Reilly was the proprietor of the

refuse to accept the bail offered till the end of the

being fully conversant with the intricate workings

redeem it the next day. His request was granted,

O’Reilly went to the Countess for the plate in
question, which consisted of “two soup-ladles, two
candlesticks, two salt-cellars, two pepper-castors, six

had freed the prisoner was highly exasperated and
demanded the plate, which had consequently been
given him. As Aylett, on the other hand, when
questioned, declared that Crisp “was a liar,” “it was

as he termed it, of which he was the victim the most
curious is undoubtedly the unexpected advent of
Aylett upon the scene in a rôle totally unconnected
with the development, so to speak, of the plot of
the play. Considering that he was the first person

to render the truth of any statement he might make
extremely doubtful, if not to invalidate it altogether.
Like Reynolds and Priddle, he was a rascally attorney
who had been “convicted of perjury and exposed
in the pillory.” Granting that he had defended
Balsamo in his action against Dr. Benamore, and
was sufficiently struck by the resemblance of
Cagliostro to his old client as to believe them to
be the same person, his conduct on the present
occasion was decidedly ambiguous. According to his
statement, “happening one day in 1777 to be in
Westminster Hall, he perceived a person that he
immediately recognized as Balsamo, whom he had
not seen since 1772.” Instead of accosting him then
and there, he decided to find out where he lived; and
after much difficulty learnt that the person he had seen
and believed to be Balsamo was in the King’s Bench
prison and that his name was Cagliostro; whereupon,without taking the least step to ascertain whether he
was right or not in his surmise, he laid a detainer
against him for the money Balsamo owed him. No
record of any kind exists as to what passed between
Aylett and Cagliostro when they finally met, or in fact
whether they met at all.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

Cagliostro’s plate or money from Crisp, have admitted
he had made a mistake is, judging from the man’s
character, not to be credited. But what renders this
singular matter still more questionable is the fact that
the Editor of theCourier de l’Europenine years later,[Pg 71]when publishing his “incontestable proofs” of the
identity of Balsamo with Cagliostro, should have
accepted the statement of Aylett andignoredthat of Dr. Benamore, who was also living at the
time and whose position as representative in England
for thirty years of the various Barbary States would,
to say the least, have given the weight of respectability

proved charges of embezzlement, but in the secrets of
the crucible and the mysteries of Egyptian Masonry,
it is clearly by his adventures in the laboratory and

Ages, when Christianity finally superseded Paganism,
the supernatural once more took up its abode in
religion. Demonology, which had survived all the
revolutions of antiquity, and which still exists without
much fundamental difference under other forms all
over the world, assimilated itself to the dogmas of the
Church. The Popes affirmed the popular belief in
sorcery, magic and diabolic possession. But the
supernatural phenomena associated with the belief in
these things were regarded as the work of the devil,
in whose existence the Christian world believed as
implicitly as in the existence of God; so while the
Church sanctioned this belief as one of the mysteries
of religion it waged a merciless war against all persons
suspected of having commerce with demons. From
its terrible ban the mystical visionaries alone were
exempt. These persons, ascetics all, the sanctity

255,CHAPTER I,"As the alchemists, owing to their superior knowledge,
and the results they obtained, were more
considered than the astrologers and sorcerers, alchemy
developed into a science at an early date. The
obscurity in which its origin is involved is a sign
of its antiquity. Some enthusiasts believe it to be
coeval with the creation of man. Vincent de Beauvais
was of the opinion that all the antediluvians must have
had some knowledge of alchemy, and cites Noah as
having been acquainted with theelixir vitae, “otherwise
he could not have lived to so prodigious an age
and begotten children when upwards of five hundred.”
Others have traced it to the Egyptians, from whom
Moses was believed to have learnt it. Martini, on the
other hand, affirms that alchemy was practised by
the Chinese two thousand five hundred years before
the birth of Christ. But though a belief in the transmutation
of metals was general in the Roman Empire,
the practice of alchemy does not appear to have
received much consideration before the eighth century.
At this period the discoveries of Gebir, an Arabian
alchemist, gave so great a stimulus to the quest of[Pg 79]the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life that he
is generally regarded as the creator of these picturesque
delusions, which for a thousand years had so great

too vast and important a rôle in the history of
humanity to be despised, wild and romantic though
this rôle has been. Nothing could be more unjust
and absurd than to judge it by the charlatans who
exploited it. The alchemists whom history still
remembers were in reality the pioneers of civilization,
who, venturing ahead of the race befogged in dense
forests of ignorance and superstition, cut a road
through to the light, along which mankind travelled
slowly in their wake. Not only were these fantastic
spirits of light the parents of modern science and
physics, but they have helped to adorn literature and
art. Some idea of their importance may be gathered
from the many words in common use that they have
given to the language, such as:crucible,amalgam,alcohol,potash,laudanum,precipitate,saturation,distillation,quintessence,affinity, etc.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

to Roger Bacon for the telescope, the magic lantern,
and gunpowder; to Van Helmont for the properties
of gas; to Paracelsus, the most extraordinary of them
all, for laudanum. It is to him also that medicine[Pg 80]owes the idea of the clinic. As in chemistry so in

there arose a mysterious sect in Germany known as
the Rosicrucians, who were destined to revolutionize
the belief in the supernatural. They claimed to derive
their name from a certain Christian Rosencreutz who,
in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had been initiated
into the mysteries of the wisdom of the East. The
tenets of the Rosicrucians, as well as their existence,
were first made known to the world at the beginning

to deny that such a person as Rosencreutz ever
existed. Such writers attribute the origin of the
society to the theories of Paracelsus and Dr. Dee,
who unconsciously became the real though unrecognized
founders of the Rosicrucians. Be this as it may,
no sooner were their doctrines generally known than
all the alchemists and believers in the marvellous
hastened to accept them. The influence thus acquired
by the “Society of the Rose-Cross” was as beneficial
as it was far-reaching. Its character was a sort of
Protestant mysticism, and its chief aim the gratuitous
healing of the sick. Hitherto alchemy and the belief
in the supernatural had been grossly materialistic.
The Rosicrucians refined the one and spiritualized the
other. They claimed that by strictly conforming to[Pg 82]the rules of their philosophy, of which chastity was
the most rigorous and important, they could ignore
hunger or thirst, enjoy perfect health, and prolong
their lives indefinitely. Of the occult knowledge they
possessed, that of transmuting metals into gold was
stripped of its old significance. The philosopher’s
stone was no longer to be regarded as merely the
means of acquiring riches, but the instrument by which
mankind could command the service of the spirits of
the invisible world.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

terrifying demons with which the monks had peopled
the unseen, but mild, beautiful, and beneficent sprites,
anxious to be of service to men. In the Rosicrucian
imagination there existed in each element a race of
spirits peculiar to it. Thus the air was inhabited by
Sylphs, the water by Undines, the earth by Gnomes,
and the fire by Salamanders. It was by them that all
that was marvellous was done. In the course of their
development the mystical tendencies of the Rosicrucians
became more and more pronounced. Thus
they finally came to regard the philosopher’s stone as
signifying contentment, the secret of which was compared
in the mystical phraseology they adopted to

effected without interruption. Towards the beginning[Pg 83]of the eighteenth century the bridge, undermined by

startled by a series of miracles performed at the grave
of Deacon Pâris, a famous martyr in the cause of

form of cures such as at the present day are to be

people, whom the doctors were unable to restore to
health, began to flock to the Jansenist Cemetery of St.
Médard, where it was discovered that other graves
beside that of Deacon Pâris, and finally the whole
cemetery shared the healing properties of his ashes.
The hitherto simple character of the cures was
changed. They were accompanied by extraordinary
convulsions, considered more divine than the cures
themselves, in which the bones cracked, the body was

detected “all the signs of the general Revolution with
which Europe is menaced.” With the passing of Louis

displayed the same predatory and brutal instincts as
the intolerant religion in whose iron carapace it

“freeing God”; and all sorts and conditions of
athletes entered the arena to battle with prejudice and
injustice. In France, where the contest was destined

punishment that brute authority awarded those who
dared to defy it. But to crush the rebellion of intelligence
against stupidity was impossible. The efforts of
the philosophers were reinforced by sovereigns imbued
with the spirit of the century. With Frederick the
Great a race of benevolent despots sprang into existence,
who dazzled by the refulgence of the philosophical
light they so much admired did not perceive till too late
that in igniting their torches at its flame they were
helping to kindle a conflagration destined to destroy

To them as well as to their princely disciples
“to free God” was another name for religious
toleration. That was the revolution for which the
Encyclopedists worked, and which Frederick the Great
and the sovereigns who shared his enlightened opinions
desired. Nothing was further from their intention
than that it should take the form in which it eventually
came. It is impossible to believe that the Revolution
which demanded the heads of a Lavoisier and a
Bailly would have spared those of a Voltaire or a[Pg 98]Rousseau. Least of all would the stupid mob that
watched the victims doomed to the guillotine “spit
into the basket,” as it termed in ferocious jest the fall
of the heads beneath the axe, have made any distinction

times” as Louis XV, the cult of the supernatural
was an element unworthy of serious consideration.
But though long ignored the time was to come when
it obtained from the torch-bearers of reason a questionable
and dangerous patronage. It was on the eve
of the birth of Freedom that “the century of Voltaire,”

which Louis Blanc has called the intoxication[Pg 99]of intelligence, had begun to doubt everything by

The sneers of Voltaire were succeeded by the tears
of Rousseau. The age of sensibility followed the age
of unbelief. This was the hour for which a despised
occultism had waited. It alone had a clear and
definite conception of the Revolution. Patronized by
philosophy, which vacillated between sentiment and
reason, it imbued it finally with its own revolutionary

by the declaration of Condorcet, “that volcano covered

Saint-Martin endeavoured to detach himself and his
adherents from the magic in which Pasqualis—who
practised it openly—had involved this sect. But
though he gave up the quest of supernatural
phenomena as unnecessary to an acquaintance with
the unseen, and wandered deeper and deeper into
pure mysticism, he never wholly succeeded in escaping
from the grosser influence of his first initiation in the
occult. From the fact, however, that he called himself
the “Robinson Crusoe of spiritualism,” some idea
may be gained of the distance that separated him
from those who also claimed connection with the
invisible world. He did not count on being understood.
Of one of his books he said, “it is too far
from ordinary human ideas to be successful. I have[Pg 102]often felt in writing it as if I were playing valses on

having at this time by his cures, and fully alive to the
powerful hold the passion for the supernatural had
obtained on the popular imagination, he decided to
give his society a mystic character as a means of[Pg 104]recruiting followers. As Weishaupt’s object was to
convert them into blind instruments of his supreme
will, he modelled his organization after that of the
Jesuits, adopting in particular their system of espionage,
their practice of passive obedience, and their maxim
that the end justifies the means. From mysticism he
borrowed the name of the society: Illuminés. From
freemasonry, the classes and grades into which they were
subdivided, the purpose of which was to measure the
progress of the adept in assimilating the doctrine of
the absolute equality of man and to excite his imagination
by making him hope for the communication of some
wonderful mystic secret when he reached the highest
grade. Those who enjoyed the confidence of Weishaupt
were known asareopagites. To them alone was
he visible, and as he deemed that too many precautions
could not be observed in concealing the existence of a
society sworn to the abolition of the Christian religion
and the overthrow of the established social system, he

real objects of Illuminism being artfully concealed, the
society extended within the course of four or five years
all over Germany. Its adepts even had a hand in
affairs of State and gained the ear of many of those
petty and picturesque sovereigns of the Empire who,
catching the fever of philosophy from Frederick the
Great and Joseph II, amused themselves in trying to[Pg 105]blend despotism, philanthropy, and the occult. As
the Illuminés were utterly unscrupulous, they did not
hesitate to seek recruits in the Church of Rome itself,

carefully chosen—Weishaupt himself was scarcely
twenty-eight when he founded the sect in 1776—did
not make much progress, till Baron von Knigge joined
them in 1780. He possessed the one faculty that
Weishaupt lacked—imagination. Young, monstrously
licentious, irreligious and intelligent, he was consumed
with an insatiable curiosity for fresh experiences. He
had written a number of novels which had attracted
some attention and certain pamphlets on morals that
had been put on the Index. He had been admitted
to most of the secret societies of the day, particularly
that of the Freemasons. He had experimented in
alchemy and studied every phase of occultism from the
philosophy of the Gnostics to that of Swedenborg.
Everything that savoured of the supernatural had a
profound attraction for him; even sleight of hand
tricks, it is said, had engaged his attention. At thirty
he had seen, studied and analyzed everything, and still
his imagination remained as untired and inquisitive as

grades after the manner of the Freemasons, and
adopted the method of initiation of which the mysterious
and terrifying rites were well calculated to impress
the proselyte. With a Knigge to invent and a Weishaupt
to organize, the Illuminés rapidly increased their
numbers and activities. Overrunning Germany they
crossed the frontiers preaching, proselytizing, and
spreading the gospel of the Revolution everywhere.
But this rapid development was not without its dangers.
Conscious that the existence of such a society if it
became known would inevitably lead to its suppression,
Knigge, who was nothing if not resourceful, conceived
the idea of grafting it on to Freemasonry, which by

and creeds sworn to secrecy, bound together by
strange symbols and signs, whose real mystic meaning
has long been forgotten, and to-day devoted to the
practice of philanthropy on an extensive scale—has
been the subject of much speculation. The theory,
most generally accepted, is that which supposes it to
have been founded at the time and for the purpose of
building the Temple of Solomon. But whatever its
early history, Freemasonry in its present form first
came into prominence in the seventeenth century in
England, whence it spread to France and Germany.
It was introduced into the former country by the
Jacobites early in the eighteenth century with the[Pg 107]object of furthering the cause of the Stuarts. On the
extinction of their hopes, however, it reverted to its
original ideals of equality and fraternity, and in spite
of these democratic principles obtained a strong hold
upon the aristocracy. Indeed, in France it was from
the first a decidedly royalist institution and this
character it preserved, outwardly at least, down to the

Jesuits had sworn allegiance to the Pope and in their
ambition to control the Papacy were its staunchest
defenders. But the Freemasons refused to admit the
Papal authority, and treated all creeds with equal
respect. War between the Church of Rome and
Freemasonry was thus inevitable—a war that the
Church in such a century as the eighteenth, permeated
with scepticism and the desire for individual liberty,

period of its history no homogeneity, it was possible for[Pg 109]anybody with a few followers to form a lodge,
and for each lodge to be a distinct society united
to Freemasonry by the community of signs and
symbols. It thus became a vast confederation of
independent lodges representing all sorts of opinions,
often hostile to one another, and possessing each
its own “rite” or constitution. Philosophy and

their aims tended to weaken rather than strengthen
the association. At length, the discovery that
impostors, like Schröpfer, Rosicrucians and even
Jesuits had founded lodges led to a general council
of Freemasons for the purpose of giving the society
the homogeneity it lacked. With this object a
convention of Masons was held at Wilhelmsbad in
1782 to which deputies were sent from all parts of
Europe. Knigge and Weishaupt attended and, perceiving
the vast possibilities of the consolidation of

to assist it, so now he proceeded on similar lines.
That the thoughts of others besides himself should be
concentrated on the “magic dream,” the relations of
the Countess, as well as herself, were duly agitated by
its expectation. With an air of great mystery, which
Cagliostro could make so impressive, he delivered to
Count von Medem a sealed envelope containing, he
said, a question, which he hoped by the dream to have
answered. At night, before the Countess retired, he
broke the silence which he had imposed on her and her
relations during the day to refer once more to the
dream, with the object of still further exciting the

on seeing her brother. Nevertheless, he dared not
deprive her of all hope. In response to her pleading,

apparition, “being warned by Hanachiel that the vision
of her brother would endanger the Countess’s life in her
excitable state.” And to render this explanation the
more convincing he gave the von Medems, who were

sincerity. The very boldness of such a request was
sufficient to disarm her. She herself has confessed, in

through the haunted forest in which the treasure was
said to be buried. Hereupon he cried out in wild

Cagliostro had left Mittau—that the Countess von der

opinion she was converted by one Bode whom she
met in Weimar and who, she says, gave her “the

the treasure as soon as they alighted. Cagliostro,
however, “after withdrawing to commune in solitude
with Hanachiel,” declared that the treasure was
guarded by very powerful demons whom it was
dangerous to oppose without taking due precautions.
“To prevent them from spiriting it away without his
knowledge” he performed a little incantation which
was supposed to bind Hanachiel to keep an eye on
them. The next day, to break the fall, so to speak,
of the high hopes the von Medems had built on the
buried treasure, he held a séance in which the infant
medium was again the chief actor. The child—“holding
a large iron nail,” and with only a screen between
it and the other members of the party, having presumably
been hypnotized[15]by Cagliostro—described[Pg 138]the site of the buried treasure, the demon that guarded
it, the treasure itself, and “seven angels in long
white robes who helped Hanachiel keep an eye on
the guardian of the treasure.” At the command of
Cagliostro the child kissed, and was kissed by, these

these phenomena made upon her mind was
profound, it was also unfavourable. Though curiosity
caused her to witness these séances, the Countess von

grounds.” Like many another, what she could not
explain, she regarded as evil. The phenomena she
witnessed appeared so uncanny that she believed
them to be directly inspired by the powers of darkness.
At first, in her admiration of Cagliostro, she prayed
that he might escape temptation and be preserved
from the demons with which it was but too evident to
her he was surrounded. When at last he declared
that he was informed by the ever-attendant Hanachiel[Pg 139]that the demon who guarded the buried treasure was
not to be propitiated without much difficulty and
delay, it did not occur to her to doubt him. The
wonders he had been performing daily had convinced

strange mixture of sublimity and frivolity.” It was by
these lectures that he unconsciously lost the respect
of the Countess he strove so hard to preserve. One
day, while expatiating on the times when the sons
of God loved the daughters of men, as described in
the Bible—which, he predicted, would return when
mankind was morally regenerate—carried away by his
subject he declared that, “not only the demi-Gods of

was just the man to appreciate the possibilities of such
a reputation in obtaining recruits for Illuminism.
Nothing is more reasonable, then, than to assume that
certain members of the Illuminés made overtures at

the Grand Masters of the Templars.” Then followed
the formula of an oath written in blood, to which
eleven signatures were appended, and which signified
that Illuminism was a conspiracy against thrones. The
first blow was to be struck in France, and, after the[Pg 157]fall of the monarchy, Rome was to be attacked.

Egyptian Masonry, he was anxious to secure that of
the masses. So great was the importance he attached
to the interest he had aroused, he even took up his[Pg 159]abode among them, “living first over a retail tobacconist’s

Cagliostro. If a rich invalid desired his attendance he
referred him to the regular doctors. Though such an

by selfish considerations. In the disdain he affected
for the rich there was much real resentment. Through
the rich and powerful, he had gained nothing but mortification
and disgrace. The circumstances under which

to the quick a nature in which inordinate vanity and
generosity were so curiously blended. Of a certainty
it was not alone the hope of turning Illuminism to the
advantage of Egyptian Masonry that prompted him
to join the Illuminés in his hour of humiliation. In
Illuminism, whose aim, revolutionary though it was,
like that of Egyptian Masonry, was also inspired with
the love of humanity, Cagliostro had seen both a[Pg 161]means of rehabilitation and revenge. Of studied vengeance,
however, he was incapable; the disdain with
which he treated the rich was the extent of his revenge.
Indeed, susceptible as he was to flattery, it was not
long before his resentment was altogether appeased.
But though, in spite of his bitter experience, he was
even once more tempted to court the favour of the

after differing widely as to the cause of his malady,
had finally pronounced his condition to be desperate.
Thereupon the Cardinal, who had boundless confidence
in Cagliostro’s medical skill, immediately carried him
off in his carriage to Paris to attend his cousin, simply
stating, on arriving at the Hôtel de Soubise, that he
had brought “a doctor,” without mentioning his name,
lest the family, influenced by the regular physicians,[Pg 165]who regarded him as a quack, should refuse his

as rivals, and declared that the prestige of both is to
be traced to the same source. According to this point
of view, Cagliostro, being more encyclopedic than
Mesmer, though less scientific in manipulating the
agent common to both, had in some way generalized
magnetism, so to speak. His cures, however, were
far more astonishing than Mesmer’s, for they were
performed without passes or the use of magnets and
magnetic wands. Neither did he heal merely bytouching, like Gassner, nor by prayers, exorcisms, and
the religious machinery by which faith is made active;
though very probably the greater part of his success
was due, like Mrs. Eddy’s, to the confident tone in[Pg 167]which he assured his patients of the certainty of their

The old popular belief in medicinal stones and magical
herbs was still prevalent. One writer of the period
pretended to know that Cagliostro’s “Elixir Vitæ”
was composed of “magical herbs and gold in solution.”
Another declared it to be the same as the elixir of
Arnauld de Villeneuve, a famous alchemist of the

the case against Cagliostro rests is that of manufacturing
his remedies with the object of defrauding the public
by attributing to them fabulous properties which he
knew they did not possess. If this be admitted, then a
similar accusation must be made against every maker

that she specially distinguished a Chevalier d’Oisemont

reference to her supposed infidelity, “why suppose
without proof?” Of Cagliostro’s devotion to her at
least there is no doubt. So little is known of her
character that it is impossible to speak of it with any

this made her at least forty when she did not appear to

prodigious furore he created to the account of Egyptian
Masonry. Not long after his arrival in Paris a lodge
was established at the residence of one of his followers
in a room specially set apart for the purpose and
furnished, says the Inquisition-biographer, “with
unparalleled magnificence.” Here from time to time
the “seven angels of the Egyptian Paradise, who
stand round the throne of God—Anaël, Michael,

house, when the angels came at the bidding of other
members besides the Grand Cophta. It was not long
before similar phenomena were witnessed in all the
Egyptian lodges. In a remarkable letter of an adept
of the lodge at Lyons found in Cagliostro’s papers at
the time of his arrest in Rome, the writer, in describing
a ceremony held there, said that “the first philosopher
of the New Testamentappeared without being called,
and gave the entire assembly, prostrate before the blue

was nothing more or less than the discovery of the
“psychic”—the word must serve for want of a better—properties
latent in every human being, and which
in many are capable of a very high degree of development.

which Cagliostro’s own “psychic” powers had now

utterances that he never completely understood them.
A link between the old conception of magic and the
new theosophical theories, there are many indications
that he regarded the phenomena he performed
as direct manifestations of divine power. In an
age of unbelief he always spoke of God with the
greatest respect, even in circles in which it was the
fashion to decry the goodness as well as the existence
of the Supreme Being. Like all the mystics of
the eighteenth century, he was deistic. “All duty,
according to him,” says Georgel, “was based on the
principle: Never do to others what you would not
wish them to do to you.” One of the first things seen

thrones and altars, and despised occultism, declares[Pg 209]that Cagliostro’s phenomena “cast suspicion on his

has dreamt of investigating—than to the belief that he
debased his ideals. As his “psychic” powers developed
it cannot be denied that he attached a significance to
them that, in the opinion of thoughtful people, was
calculated to render his motives suspect. His real
imposture was not in cheating people of their money
or faking miracles, but in encouraging the belief that
he was a supernatural being—“I am that I am,” as
he is said to have described himself profanely on one

even insufferable. Pompous in Mittau, he became
arrogant, domineering, and choleric in Paris. Flattery,[Pg 211]to which he had always been peculiarly susceptible,

was calculated to repel rather than to attract. It was
the wonder-man, and not the idealist, in whom Paris
was interested. But instead of taking the line of least

had brought from the East. As no one ever ventured
to regard him as a fool as well as a knave, it is impossible
to question his sincerity in the matter. At once
the seventy-two Masonic lodges of Paris rose in arms[Pg 212]against him. He managed, however, to triumph over

Langes was well acquainted with Cagliostro, and the
importance he attached to him was so great that he
desired to incorporate the sect of Egyptian Masonry

to acknowledge the superiority of the Egyptian Rite.
So with pompous condescension, which was as astute as
it was bizarre, he informed them that “having deigned

immense desire I had to regain the favour of the
Queen,” he said at his trial, in reply to the observations[Pg 220]of the judges how a man so cultivated, so intelligent,

Day, the one day in the year on which the Cardinal
was entitled to appear at Versailles, when as Grand
Almoner he celebrated mass to which the Royal
Family always went in state. He and the Court were
waiting in the Oeil-de-Boeuf for the King and Queen
to appear in order to accompany them to the Chapel
of St. Louis, when a door opened and a chamberlain
summoned his Eminence to the sovereign. Everybody
knows what followed. Böhmer, having obtained
an audience of Louis XVI, had related to that amazed
monarch all the details of the transaction by which the
necklace had been bought for the Queen. This story,
repeated in the presence of Marie Antoinette, whose
honesty and virtue it alike impugned, stung her to
fury. Exasperated though she was by Böhmer’s
assertion that she had purchased his necklace, which
for ten years she had refused to do, she might nevertheless
have excused him on the ground of his insanity.
But when he charged her with having employed
Rohan, whom she hated, to purchase the necklace[Pg 224]through a confidante of whom she had never heard,
she was transported with indignation. Forgetting
that she was a Queen, which she did too often, she
remembered only that she was a woman, and without
thinking of the consequences, insisted that the Cardinal
should be arrested and her reputation publicly vindicated.
Louis XVI, whose misfortune it was to be
guided by her when he shouldn’t, and never when he
should—a misfortune that in the end was to cost him

which he had excited was general and anything but
reverent. The exaggerated enthusiasm of his followers,
the incredible stories related of him, and the
extreme seriousness with which he took himself made
him ridiculous. If he was the chief subject of conversation

him that the public looked to supply the comic relief.

The consciousness of innocence is not necessarily a

stimulates—according to the temperament. Cagliostro

imagination haunted by old legends made deeper than

were printed and sold in accordance with the legal
custom of the day, she boldly charged Cagliostro with
the robbery of the necklace. He was represented as
an impostor to make him the more easily appear a[Pg 234]swindler. To penetrate the mystery in which he had
wrapped his origin she invented for him a low and
shameful past, which the editor of theCourier de
l’Europeand the Inquisition-biographer afterwards
merged into Giuseppe Balsamo’s. She ridiculed his
cures, and cited the Medical Faculty as witnesses of
the deaths he had caused. She declared his disinterestedness
and his generosity to be a fraud, and
accused him of practising in private the vices he
denounced in public. Having stripped him of the
last stitch of respectability she proceeded to expose
the woman who passed as his wife, and whoseliaisonswith the Cardinal and others she declared he encouraged.
As for the wonders he was said to perform
they were not even worthy of the name of tricks; only
fools were taken in by them. In fine, to Madame
de Lamotte, the Grand Cophta was nothing but “an
arch empiric, a mean alchemist, a dreamer on the
philosophers stone, a false prophet, and a Jew who
had taken to pieces the necklace which he had
beguiled the Cardinal, over whom he had gained an

The gibberish he employed rendered him and his

finish the president seemed to be on the point of

Directed against Breteuil, whose unpopularity, already
great, it increased, it assailed more or less openly the
monarchical principle itself. Of all the pamphlets
which from the Necklace Affair to the fall of the
Bastille attacked the royal authority none are so
dignified or so eloquent. The longing for freedom,
which was latent in the bosom of every man and
which the philosophers and the secret societies had
been doing their best to fan into a flame, was revealed
in every line. It was not unreasonably regarded as
the confession of faith of an Illuminé. The Inquisition-biographer
declares that it was conceived in a spirit so
calculated to excite a revolt that “it was with difficulty
a printer could be found in England to print it.”[Pg 255]Cagliostro himself admits that it was written with “a
freedom rather republican.”[37]",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

other and still more seditious pamphlets? There was
but one way to prevent this contingency—to kidnap him.

For the object he had in view Madame du Barry was
a gold mine. The famous favourite of Louis XV was
notoriously sensitive on the subject of her reputation,
and dreaded nothing so much as a libel. Morande,
accordingly, wrote to inform her that he had in
preparation a work in four volumes, to be entitled theMémoires d’une femme publique, in which she would
figure as the heroine, unless she preferred to pay a
handsome sum for its suppression. To assist her to
come to the latter decision a scenario of the work was
sent her. “Le Gazetier Cuirassé,” says Bachaumont,
who saw it, “was rose-water in comparison with this
newchef-d’œuvre.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
854,CHAPTER I,"Alarmed and enraged, the poor creature communicated
her fears and anger to the King, who applied
to George III for Morande’s extradition. The attitude
of the British Government was characteristic of the
political morality of the age. The laws and customs
of England rendering the extradition of a foreign
refugee out of the question, the French Court was[Pg 263]informed that failing an action for libel—which under
the circumstances was clearly impossible—the only
alternative was to kidnap the libellist. The British
Government even offered its assistance, providing that
Morande’s “removal was done with the greatest secrecy

susceptibilities.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

brigade of police to London, but Morande was on the
alert. Warned from Paris of his danger, he exposed
the contemplated attack upon him in the Press, giving
himself out as “a political exile and an avenger of
public morality”—poses, needless to say, which are
always applauded in England. Public sympathy was
thus excited in his favour to such a pitch that the
French police were obliged to return to France empty-handed,

into the Thames by an infuriated crowd.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

the French Government, redoubled his threats. He
wrote again to Madame du Barry to inform her that
6,000 copies of his scandalous work were already
printed and ready for circulation. Louis XV, who
had no more fear of a libel than Voltaire, would have
let him do his worst, but to please his mistress he
decided to come to terms. As this had now become
a delicate matter, Beaumarchais was entrusted with
the negotiation on account of his superior cunning.
The celebrated author who had everything to gain by
earning the gratitude of Madame du Barry went to
London under the name of Ronac, and in a very short
time succeeded in gaining the confidence of the libellist,
whose silence was purchased for the sum of 32,000[Pg 264]livres in cash and a pension of 4,000 livres, to be paid

altogether abandoning his career of blackmail, adopted
the more profitable one of spy. Instead of attacking

foolishly endeavoured to circumvent the laws respecting[Pg 265]the liberty of the Press by placing an embargo on
the bales of the paper destined for export. But
Swinton parried this blow by causing it to be printed
simultaneously at Boulogne. “Whereupon,” says
Brissot, “the English Government resigned itself to
the inevitable and suffered theCourier de l’Europeto

orders, on September 1, 1786. For three months he
bombarded Cagliostro unceasingly in a long series of

with a devilish cleverness. Like the Countess de[Pg 266]Lamotte, he did not hesitate to deny his own statements
when others could be made more serviceable.
Thus, after affirming “Nature’s unfortunate child” to
be the son of a coachman of the Neapolitan Duke of
Castropignani, he declared him to be the valet of the

calumny to calumny, without knowing where he was
going, so to speak, Morande finally arrived at Giuseppe
Balsamo—as described at the beginning of the book.
The discovery of Balsamo was a veritabletrouvaille.
It enabled Morande to tack on to the variegated
career of the Sicilian scoundrel all that he had hitherto
affirmed of Cagliostro’s past life without appearing
to contradict himself. Once on Balsamo’s track, he
never lost scent of him. He ferreted out or invented
all the stories concerning the Balsamos: their marriage,
the manner in which they had lived, their forgeries,
blackmail, poverty, licentiousness, imprisonment—everything,
in fact, that could damage Cagliostro andhiswife. He found people, moreover, to swear to the
truth of all he said, or rather he asserted it, and on the
strength of their accusations caused Cagliostro to be
sued for debts incurred in the name of Balsamo years
before. He collected all the hostile reports of the
enemies the Grand Cophta had made in his travels
through Europe and afterwards in the Necklace Affair,
and re-edited them with the precision of an historian[Pg 267]and the malice of a personal enemy. Then, after
having done him all the injury he could and given the
French Government full value for its money, Morande
with brazen effrontery proposed to Cagliostro that he
should purchase the silence of theCourier!",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

it said—to ignore the feigned indignation of the
libellist who had been hired to ruin him. Aided by
Thilorier,[42]his brilliant counsel in the Necklace Affair,
who happened to be in England, the wonder-worker
published aLetter to the English People, in which he
flung in the face of the blackmailer all the atrocious acts
of his own past. Morande, however, aware that any
effort on his part to clear himself of these accusations
would be useless, sought to distract attention from the
subject by daring Cagliostro to disprove the charges
made in theCourier. At the same time he thought to
stab him to silence by covering with ridicule a statement
which he asserted Cagliostro had made to the
effect that “the lions and tigers in the forests of
Medina were poisoned by the Arabians by devouring
hogs fattened on arsenic for the purpose.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

physics and chemistry, arguments avail little, persiflage
nothing; it is experiment alone that counts. Permit

will divert the public either at your expense or
mine. I invite you to lunch with me on November 9

healthy, and I will not come near it till it is served on

chosen the portion that you prefer, you shall give me
what you think proper. The next day one of four
things will occur: either we shall both be dead, or we
shall neither of us be dead; or I shall be dead and
you will not; or you will be dead and I shall not. Of

blunted by over-taxing his imagination in the attempt to

by the 5,000 guineas, he suggested “that the test
should take place in public, and that some other carnivorous
animal should be substituted for the pig
fattened on arsenic.” But this suggestion, which
revealed his cowardice by reducing the culinary duel

“and suggest as a substitute some other carnivorous
animal? But that was not my proposal. Such a
guest would only very imperfectly represent you.
Where would you find a carnivorous animal which
amongst its own species is what you are amongst
men? It is not your representative, but yourself, with
whom I wish to treat. The custom of combat by
champions has long gone out of fashion, and even if I
allowed you to restore it, honour would forbid me to
contend with the champion you offer. A champion
should not have to be dragged into the arena, but
enter it willingly; and however little you may know

Court dared not reply. The man he had been hired to
defame with his venomous pen had the laugh on his
side. The public, moreover, were beginning to detect
the mercenary hireling in the detractor, and as the
gallery had ceased to be amused Morande, to avoid
losing what reputation he possessed, suddenly ceased

Cagliostro, he had received a mortal wound. The
poisoned pigs of the Arabians were not more destructive
than the poisoned pen of Theveneau de Morande. The
persistency of his attacks, the ingenuity of his detraction,
were more effective than the most irrefutable
proof. His articles, in spite of their too evident[Pg 270]hostility, their contradictions, their statements either
unverifiable or based on the testimony of persons
whose reputations alone made it worthless, created a
general feeling that the man whom they denounced
was an impostor. The importance of the paper in
which they appeared, quoted by other papers, all of
Europe, served to confirm this impression. Thus the
world, whose conclusions are formed by instinct rather
than reason, forgetting that it had ridiculed as improbable
Cagliostro’s own story of his life, accepted the
amazing and still more improbable past that Morande
“unmasked” without reservation. Nor did the Court
of Versailles and its friends, nor all the forces of
law and order which, threatened everywhere, made
common cause with the threatened French monarchy,
fail to circulate and confirm by every means in their
power the statements of Morande. As if the stigma

every bit as unprincipled as his editor. A Scotchman

married, and made his fortune in France. On settling
in London he had drifted naturally into the French
colony, in which, by reason of his sympathies, connections
and interests he had acquired great influence,
which he turned to account on every possible occasion.
One of his many profitable enterprises was a “home”
for young Frenchmen employed in London. “He also
ran a druggist’s shop,” says Brissot, “in the name of
one of his clerks, and a restaurant in the name of
another.”[43]And when Cagliostro arrived in London
with a letter of introduction to him, Swinton, who was
as full of schemes as he was devoid of principle,
thought to run him, too, for his own profit. The[Pg 274]wonder-worker with his elixirs, his balsams, and his

language and customs of the country in which he had
sought refuge, Swinton, who was assiduous in his
attentions, rented him a house in Sloane Street, for
which he desired a tenant, induced him to pay the cost
of repairing it, and provided him with the furniture he
needed at double its value. To prevent any one else
from interfering with the agreeable task of plucking so
fat a bird, and at the same time the better to conceal
his duplicity, Swinton endeavoured to preclude all
approach to his prey. It was to this end that he made
trouble between Cagliostro and O’Reilly. Having
succeeded thus far in his design he redoubled his
attentions, and urged Cagliostro to give a public
exhibition of his healing powers, as he had done at
Strasburg. But warned by previous experience of the
danger of exciting afresh the hostility of the doctors,
Cagliostro firmly refused. Swinton then proposed to
become his apothecary, and to push the sale of the
Grand Cophta’s various medicaments, of which his
druggist’s shop should have the monopoly, in theCourier de l’Europe.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

Morande afterwards declared, the exorbitant profit to
be derived from their sale. Perceiving that he was
not to be persuaded by fair means, Swinton injudiciously
tried to put on the screw. But his threats,
far from accomplishing their purpose, only served to[Pg 275]betray his designs, and so disgusted Cagliostro that
he ceased to have any further communication with
him. Swinton, however, was not to be got rid of in
any such fashion. Living next door to his enemy, his

to capture Cagliostro were two attempts to obtain his
arrest by inducing persons to take out writs against

custom of merely swearing to a debt to procure a writ
rendered easy. In this way Priddle, who had behaved
so scurvily in Cagliostro’s arbitration suit with Miss
Fry in 1777, was induced to take out a writ for sixty
pounds, due, as he pretended, for legal business transacted
nine years before. Warned, however, that the
bailiffs were hiding in Swinton’s house to serve the writ
the moment he should appear, Cagliostro was able to
defeat their intention by procuring bail before they
could accomplish their purpose. In the end it was
Priddle who went to Newgate. But instead of the
former demand for sixty pounds, Cagliostro, by means
of one of the various legal subterfuges in the practice
of which the eighteenth century lawyer excelled, was
obliged to pay one hundred and eighty pounds and
costs.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

baited victim of ministerial tyranny and corruption was
similarly attacked from another quarter in a manner
which proves how great was the exasperation of his

a libellous pamphlet against Cagliostro—quoted by[Pg 276]Madame de Lamotte at her trial, when it was generally
regarded as worthless, and its suppression ordered by
the Parliament of Paris—appeared in London and
obtained a writ for one hundred and fifty pounds,
which, he claimed, Cagliostro owed him for the week
passed in his service in Strasburg in 1781. The
impudence of this claim on examination was, of course,
sufficient to disprove it; but Morande, who had
brought Sacchi to England and assisted him to procure
the writ, all but succeeded in having Cagliostro ignominiously
dragged to Newgate on the strength of it.
The proximity, however, of Swinton’s house—in which

held séances which many people of distinction attended.

the fall of the Bastille had released, the Jesuits, who
controlled the machinery of the Papal government,[48]strove without scruple to crush the enemies which
their arrogant intrigues had created for the Church.
To them Freemasonry was a comprehensive name for
everything and everybody opposed to them and their
pretensions. In a certain sense they were right, and
in France at any rate where the lodges and secret
societies no longer took the trouble to conceal their
aims there was no mistaking the revolutionary character
of the Freemasons. So great, therefore, was the fear
and hatred that Freemasonry inspired in the Church
that in seizing Cagliostro the Inquisition never dreamt
of charging him with any other crime. Beside it his
occult practices or the crimes of which, on the assumption
that he was Giuseppe Balsamo he might have
been condemned, paled into insignificance.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

excuse the Apostolic Court for its failure to charge
him with these offences, on the ground that “all who
could testify against him were dead” proves how
slight was the importance his judges attached to them.
Had they desired to bring him to the gallows for the
forgeries of Balsamo, the judges of the Inquisition[Pg 295]would have found the necessary witnesses. As a

to set fire to the Castle of St. Angelo or any other

death. To convict him, moreover, the Inquisition had
no lack of proof. Laubardemont, Cardinal Richelieu’s
famous police-spy, deemed a single compromising line
sufficient to hang a man. In Cagliostro’s case, thanks to
his singular lack of prudence in not destroying his
papers, the documents seized on his arrest were a

justice were observed. Permission was granted
Cagliostro to choose two lawyers to defend him.
This privilege, however, was a mockery, for his choice
was in reality limited to certain officials especially
appointed by the Apostolic Court to take charge of
such cases as his. They were not free to acquit; at
most their defence could only be a plea for mercy. In[Pg 297]the present instance, if not actually prejudiced against
their client, they certainly took no interest whatever
in him. Aware that he was utterly incapable of paying
them for their services, they grudged the time they
were obliged to devote to him. Their defence consisted

Office, whose court resembled a torture-chamber
rather than a court of justice, even his wife testified
against him.[50]But though surrounded with indifference,
contempt or hate, and threatened with death,
Cagliostro did not abandon hope. His spirit was not

had experienced since the Bastille.” He accused the
witnesses of being his enemies, and on being told that
his wife had “confessed” he denounced her as a traitress.

linen,[51]a fire and a blanket. The first and the last
alone were granted him, for the Inquisition had no
desire to have him die before they had finished trying
him. As, however, his judges professed to be deeply
concerned for the health of his soul, when to the above

“believed him, and if he flattered himself on recovering
his liberty by this means he was mistaken.” Perceiving
that this act of repentance, far from being of
any avail, only served to furnish his enemies with fresh

the “truth,” he declared that all he had said was true.

984,CHAPTER I,"Sometime in July 1776—the exact date is
unascertainable—two foreigners of unmistakable respectability,
to judge by their appearance, if not of
distinction, arrived in London and engaged a suite of
furnished apartments in Whitcombe Street, Leicester
Fields. They called themselves Count and Countess
Cagliostro; and their landlady, who lost no time in
letting everybody in the house, as well as her neighbours,
know she had people of title as lodgers, added
that she believed they were Italian, though so far as
she could understand from the Count’s very broken
English they had last come from Portugal. A day or
two later she was able to inform her gossips, which no
doubt she did with even greater satisfaction, that her
foreign lodgers were not only titled but undoubtedly
rich, for the Countess had very fine jewels and the
Count was engaged in turning one of the rooms he
had rented into a laboratory, as he intended to devote
himself to the study of physics and chemistry, subjects,
it seemed, in which he was keenly interested.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
985,CHAPTER I,"Their first visitor was a Madame Blevary, a lady
in reduced circumstances who lodged in the same[Pg 50]house. Hearing they had come from Portugal, and
being herself a native of that country, she sought their
acquaintance in the hope of deriving some personal
benefit from it. In this she was not disappointed;
for the Countess, who knew no English, required a
companion, and as Madame Blevary was conversant
with several languages and had the manners of a
gentlewoman, she readily obtained the post on the
recommendation of the landlady.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
986,CHAPTER I,"Among the acquaintances Madame Blevary informed
of her good fortune, which she was no doubt
induced to dilate upon, was a certain Vitellini, an
ex-Jesuit and professor of languages. Like her, he
too had fallen on hard times; but in his case the love
of gambling had been his ruin. He was also, as it
happened, almost equally devoted to the study of
chemistry, on a knowledge of which he particularly
piqued himself. No sooner, therefore, did he learn
that Count Cagliostro had a similar hobby, and a
laboratory into the bargain, than he persuaded Madame
Blevary to introduce him to the Count, in the hope
that he too might profit by the acquaintance as she
had done. As a result of this introduction, Vitellini
succeeded in ingratiating himself into the favour of
Cagliostro, who employed him in the laboratory as an
assistant.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
987,CHAPTER I,"Stinginess was a quality of which neither the
Count nor his wife was ever accused. On the
contrary, as even those most prejudiced against them
have been obliged to admit, they were exceedingly
generous. With them, however, generosity was one
of those amiable weaknesses that are as pernicious in
their effect as a vice. There were few who experienced[Pg 51]it but abused it in some way. It was so in this
instance.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
988,CHAPTER I,"Vitellini, who was at bottom more of a fool than a
knave, in the first flush of excitement over the sudden
turn of tide in his fortunes which had long been at the
lowest ebb, began to brag to his acquaintances in the
gambling-dens and coffee-houses he frequented of his
connection with Cagliostro, whom he described as “an
extraordinary man, a true adept, whose fortune was
immense, and who possessed the secret of transmuting
metals.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
989,CHAPTER I,"Such praise naturally excited the curiosity of
Vitellini’s acquaintances, who in their turn were eager
to meet the benevolent foreigner. Thus by the indiscretion
of Vitellini, Cagliostro was soon besieged
by a crowd of shady people whose intentions were
so apparent that he was obliged in the end to refuse
to receive them when they called. But this only
exasperated them; and one in particular, Pergolezzi—the
painter and decorator by whom the reader will
recall Balsamo was for a time employed—“threatened
to blast the reputation of the Count by circulating a
report throughout London that he was ignorant and
necessitous, of obscure birth, and had once before
resided in England.”[7]",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
990,CHAPTER I,"Vitellini, needless to say, perceiving the effect of[Pg 52]his folly, now hastened to put a curb on his tongue lest
he too should be shown the door. But as the sequel
will prove, discretion came to him too late to benefit
him. For Madame Blevary, who also entertained in
secret a similar opinion of her patron’s wealth and
knowledge, was one of those whose cupidity had been
excited by Vitellini’s gossip. She at least had the
advantage of being on the inner side of the Count’s
door, and she determined while she had the chance
to profit by it.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
991,CHAPTER I,"To this effect she bethought herself of “one Scott,
a man of ambiguous character, and the pliability of
whose principles was such that he was ever ready to
convert them to the interest of the present moment.”
It was accordingly arranged between them that Scott
should impersonate a Scotch nobleman, in which guise
it was hoped the Cagliostros would be effectually
deceived as to his intentions. A severe illness, however,
with which she was suddenly seized, and during
which the Cagliostros “supplied her with every
necessary comfort,” prevented Madame Blevary from
personally introducing her confederate. Nevertheless
she did not abandon the idea she had conceived, and
ill though she was, she sent word to Cagliostro that
“Lord Scott, of whom she had often spoken to him,
had arrived in town and proposed to himself the
honour of introduction that afternoon.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
992,CHAPTER I,"Entirely unsuspicious of the treachery of a woman
who owed so much to their generosity, the Count and
Countess received “Lord Scott” on his arrival. His
appearance, it seems, did not exactly tally with such
notions as Cagliostro had formed either of the man or
his rank. But Scott succeeded in dispelling his disappointment,[Pg 53]and swindling him into the bargain, by
way of gentle beginning, out of £12 in Portuguese
money which he undertook to get exchanged for its
English equivalent, afterwards declaring with well-feigned
mortification “he had lost it through a hole
in his pocket.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
994,CHAPTER I,"Whether Madame Blevary got a share of these or
subsequent spoils is not known, for at this point she
disappears from the scene altogether. Perhaps she
died of that severe illness in which she received from
the Cagliostros while betraying them so many “proofs
of their generosity and humanity.” In any case, her
place was most completely filled by “Lady Scott,” who
was at this period presented by Scott to the Cagliostros,
and from whom in an incredibly short time she
managed to borrow on her simple note of hand £200.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
995,CHAPTER I,II,,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
996,CHAPTER I,"Owing to the prejudice against Cagliostro, a construction
wholly unfavourable to him has been placed
upon the extraordinary series of events that now ensued.
This construction, however, cannot be allowed to pass
unchallenged. For it is based solely on the accusations
of the Editor of theCourier de l’Europe, who was the
bitter enemy of Cagliostro. Now though it may be[Pg 54]the custom in France for the accused to be considered
guilty till he proves his innocence, the contrary is the
custom in England, where fortunately it requires
something more than the mere word of a single and
professedly hostile witness to condemn a man. The
Editor of theCourier de l’Europedeclared that
“upwards of twenty persons” would confirm his
statements. None, however, offered to do so. Under
such circumstances, as we are reduced to dealing with
prejudices, I shall in this particular instance confess
to one in favour of an ancient English principle of
justice, and give Cagliostro the benefit of the doubt.
His word at least is as much entitled to respect as that
of the Editor of theCourier de l’Europe. There is,
moreover, much in his spirited defence even worthy of
credence.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

998,CHAPTER I,"Having found him so easy to dupe, the crew by
whom he was surrounded naturally devoted their
attention to increasing the friendship they had formed
with him and his wife. Not a day passed but “Lord”
Scott and his lady paid the Count and Countess a visit,
and as it was their habit to drop in just before dinner
or supper they soon managed to obtain their meals at
the expense of the hospitable foreigners.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
999,CHAPTER I,"On one of these occasions the conversation having
turned on a lottery in which his guests were interested,
Cagliostro was reminded of “a manuscript he had found
in the course of his travels which contained many
curious cabalistic operations by aid of which the author
set forth the possibilities of calculating winning
numbers.” But since the matter was not one in which
he had hitherto taken any particular interest, he was[Pg 55]unwilling to express an opinion as to the value of these
calculations, “having long contracted the habit of
suspending his judgment on subjects he had not
investigated.” On being urged, however, he consented
to consult the manuscript; whereupon, to test
its system, Scott “risked a trifle” and won upwards of a
hundred pounds.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1000,CHAPTER I,"But whatever opinion Cagliostro may now have
formed as to the value to be attached to these “cabalistic
operations,” he refused to put them to further test.
Gambling would appear to have had no attraction for
him. Not only, if we are to believe him, did he risk
nothing himself, or benefit in any way by the winning
numbers he predicted on this occasion, butnever afterwardsis there to be found any allusion to gambling
in the records that relate to his career. His aversion,
however, which others—notably Mirabeau—have also
shared, is not necessarily to be regarded as a virtue.
There are many who, without objecting to gambling
on moral grounds, are unable to find any pleasure
in it.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1001,CHAPTER I,"Apart from all other considerations, Cagliostro
had a strong personal motive for his refusal to
make a business of predicting winning numbers
for Scott. He was too completely absorbed in his
alchemical experiments to find an interest in anything
else. Of what value was the most perfect
betting system in the world compared with the secret
of transmuting metals, making diamonds, and prolonging
life? To the man who is wrapped up in such
things, lotteries and the means of winning them are
beneath contempt. He has not only got something
more profitable to do than waste his time in calculating[Pg 56]lucky numbers, but he is on a plane above the ordinary
gambler.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1002,CHAPTER I,"This, however, was a distinction that Scott, who
was merely a vulgar sharper, was incapable of either
making himself or appreciating when made. After
his success in testing the system he believed it to be
infallible. To be refused so simple a means of making
a fortune was intolerable. In his exasperation he
dropped the rôle of Scotch nobleman altogether and
appeared in his real character as the common rogue he
was, whereupon Cagliostro promptly showed him the
door and refused to have any further intercourse with him.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1003,CHAPTER I,"“Lady” Scott, however, a few days later forced
herself upon the Countess, and endeavoured to excite
her compassion with the relation of a pitiful story, in
which she declared that Scott, by whom she had been
betrayed, had decamped with the profit arising from
the lottery, leaving her and three children entirely
destitute. The Countess, touched by this imaginary
tale, generously interceded in her behalf with the
Count, who sent her “a guinea and a number for the
following day.” Miss Fry, to give her her real name,
no sooner obtained this number than she and Scott
risked every penny they could raise upon it. Fortune
once more favoured them and they won on this
occasion the sum of fifteen hundred guineas.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1004,CHAPTER I,"In the first moment of exultation Miss Fry at once
rushed off to the Cagliostros with the whole of her
winnings, which she offered to the Count as a token
of her gratitude and confidence in him. But Cagliostro
was not to be caught in this cunningly laid snare. He
received her very coldly and refused to concern himself
in her affairs.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

my doors.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1007,CHAPTER I,"But Miss Fry was not to be got rid of in this
fashion. Dazzled by the golden shower the Count’s
predictions had caused to rain upon her, she sighed
for more numbers, and to obtain them she had recourse
to Vitellini, in the hope that as he was still
employed by the Count he might succeed in getting
them for her. So eager was she to procure them that
she gave Vitellini twenty guineas in advance as an
earnest of her sincerity and to increase his zeal in the
matter.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1008,CHAPTER I,"But though Vitellini was, needless to say, only too
eager to oblige her, Cagliostro was not to be persuaded
to gratify him. Hereupon, Miss Fry, repenting of her
liberality, made a debt of her gift, and had Vitellini,
who was unable to repay her, imprisoned. Cagliostro,
however, generously came to the rescue, and obtained
his release. This action awoke a belated sense of
gratitude in the fellow, which he afterwards ineffectually
attempted to prove.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1009,CHAPTER I,"But to return to Miss Fry. Having failed to turn
Vitellini to account, she determined to approach the
Countess and lay her, if possible, under an obligation.
After considering various schemes by which this was
to be effected, she “purchased of a pawnbroker a
diamond necklace for which she paid £94.” She then
procured a box with two compartments, in one of
which she placed the necklace, and in the other some
snuff of a rare quality that she knew the Countess[Pg 58]liked, and watching for an opportunity of finding her
alone, managed to get access to her.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1010,CHAPTER I,"In the hands of a Miss Fry, the Countess, who was
the most amiable, pliable, and insignificant of creatures,
was like wax. Cleverly turning the conversation so as
to suit her purpose, Miss Fry casually produced the
box and opening the compartment containing the snuff
prevailed upon the Countess to take a pinch. After
this it was an easy matter to persuade her to keep the
box. Two days later the Countess discovered the
necklace. As she had been forbidden to receive any
presents from Miss Fry, she at once reported the
matter to her husband. He was for returning the
necklace at once, but as the Countess, who doubtless
had no desire to part with it, suggested that to do so
after having had it so long in her possession would
appear “indelicate,” Cagliostro foolishly consented to
let her keep it. As to retain the gift without acknowledging
it would have been still more indelicate, Miss
Fry was accordingly once more permitted to resume
her visits.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1011,CHAPTER I,"Fully alive to the fact that she was only received
on sufferance, she was naturally very careful not to
jeopardize the position she had recovered with so
much difficulty by any indiscretion. She by no means,
however, lost sight of the object she had in view.
Hearing that the Cagliostros were moving to Suffolk
Street, she hired a room in the same house where
it was impossible to avoid her. As she had told
Cagliostro that she intended to follow his advice and
live in the country with her three children—a fiction
to which she still adhered—he naturally inquired the
reason of her continued residence in London. She[Pg 59]gave a lack of the necessary funds as her excuse, and
hinted, as he had broached the subject, that he should
“extricate her from her embarrassment by giving her
numbers for the French lottery.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1012,CHAPTER I,"The Count ignored the hint. But in consideration
of the necklace she had given the Countess, and with
the hope of being entirely rid of her, he gave her £50
to defray the expense of her journey into the country.
This was, however, not at all to Miss Fry’s taste. She
wanted numbers for the French lottery, and meant to
have them too, or know the reason why, as the saying
is. Accordingly, the next day she trumped up some
fresh story of debts and absconding creditors, and,
appealing to the compassion of the Countess, implored
her to intercede with the Count to give her the
numbers she wanted.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1013,CHAPTER I,"Cagliostro was now thoroughly annoyed. To
settle the matter once for all, he told her that “he
believed the success of the system was due more to
chance than to calculation; but whether it was effected
by the one or the other he was resolved to have no
further concern in anything of that nature.” The
manner in which these words were uttered was too
emphatic to permit Miss Fry to continue to cherish
the least hope of ever being able to induce Cagliostro
to change his mind. Still, even now she refused to
accept defeat. The numbers had become to her like
morphia to amorphineuse; and precisely as the latter
to obtain the drug she craves will resort to the most
desperate stratagems, so Miss Fry determined to
execute a scheme she had long premeditated by
which Cagliostro was to becompelledto give her the
numbers.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

Cagliostro against the violent denunciations of the
Editor of theCourier de l’Europeas “the most diabolic
that ever entered into the heart of ingratitude,” was
nothing more nor less than a sort of muscular blackmail.
Taking advantage of his ignorance of English,
Cagliostro was to be arrested on a false charge and
simultaneously robbed of the precious manuscript by
which he predicted the numbers.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1017,CHAPTER I,"To assist in the execution of her plan Miss Fry,
who was the life and soul of the conspiracy, had the
help of a barrister named Reynolds, “who, notwithstanding
his expertness in the pettifogging finesse of the
low law, could not preserve himself from an ignominious
exhibition in the pillory”; a rough known as Broad;
and, of course, Scott.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1018,CHAPTER I,"When everything was arranged, Miss Fry brought
an action against Cagliostro to recover £190, the writ
for which was served by Reynolds, apparently by
bribing the sheriff’s officer. Thus armed, he proceeded
to Cagliostro’s house accompanied by the others, and
while he explained to the amazed Count, who had
never seen him before, the object of his visit and the
authority for what he did, Scott and Broad broke into
the laboratory, where they found and took possession
of the manuscript and the note-of-hand for the two
hundred pounds the Count had lent Miss Fry, who
during these highly criminal proceedings had the
shrewdness to “wait on the stairs” without. Reynolds
then conducted Cagliostro to a sponging-house, from[Pg 61]which he was released the following day by depositing
with Saunders, the sheriffs officer, “jewels worth three or
four hundred pounds.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

of Cagliostro, from whom they had obtained nothing
but the note-of-hand and the manuscript, of which they
could make neither head nor tail, at once renewed
their persecution. This time they procured a warrant
for the arrest of both himself and his wife on the
charge of practisingwitchcraft. The fact that it was
possible to obtain a warrant on so ridiculous a charge,
which both those who made it, as well as the official
by whom the warrant was granted, were perfectly aware
would be dismissed with contempt the moment it was
investigated, explains how easy it was, under the
corrupt and chaotic state of the legal system of the
period, to convert the protection of the law into a
persecution. Indeed, unauthenticated though they
are, none of the legal proceedings in which Cagliostro
was now involved are improbable. On the contrary

their credibility.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

that their victim was not to be terrified, his persecutors
tried other tactics. Reynolds was deputed
to persuade him, if possible, to explain the system
by which he predicted the winning numbers.
But Cagliostro indignantly refused to gratify him
when he called, whereupon Scott, who had remained
without the door, his ear glued to the key-hole,[Pg 62]perceiving that the eloquence of Reynolds failed to
produce the desired effect, suddenly burst into the room,

1021,CHAPTER I,"This species of bluff, however, was equally futile.
Cagliostro regarded the bully and his pistol with
contemptuous composure—particularly as he did not
discharge it. He assured him that nothing was to be
accomplished by solicitations or threats, but as he desired
to be left in peace he was ready “to think no more of

immediately went with Cagliostro to Saunders’ house
to settle the matter. But Saunders, realizing that
Cagliostro’s troubles were due to his gullibility, ignorance
of English, and apparent fortune, was tempted to
reserve the plucking of so fat a bird for himself. He
accordingly advised the Count not to compromise
the matter, but to bring in his turn an action for
robbery against the crew of sharpers into whose power
he had fallen. Cagliostro was easily induced to accept
this advice, and with the aid of Saunders procured
four warrants for the arrest of Scott, Reynolds, Broad,
and Miss Fry. The last, however, aware that the
charge against her could not be substantiated, as
she had not personally been present at the time of
the robbery, made no attempt to escape, and was[Pg 63]taken into custody—from which, as she had foreseen,

fury he had to deal with in Miss Fry. The two
actions she had instituted against him had not been
quashed, as she took care daily to let him know in
ways studiously calculated to render the reminder
particularly harassing. Saunders, with whom he had

more absurd is the assertion of the Editor of theCourier de l’Europe—theonlyother source of information
beside Cagliostro in regard to these proceedings—that

prisoners confined there, and even paid the debts of
some, who thus obtained their freedom.” Of these,
one “Shannon, a chemist,” is quoted by him as being
ready to testify to the truth of the statement. Be this
as it may, after six weeks Cagliostro once more returned

in his affairs was inspired by the profit he calculated on
deriving from them, also recommended him to engage

this woman’s fury, it was not surprising that he should
have attributed the extraordinary circumstances that
now occurred to her vindictive ingenuity. As he was
preparing to leave the King’s Bench, “Mr. Crisp, the
under-marshal of the prison, informed him that one
Aylett had lodged a detainer against him by name of
Melisa Cagliostro, otherwise Joseph Balsamo, for a
debt of £30.” The Count demanded with the
utmost surprise the meaning of this new intrigue.
Crisp replied that Aylett declared the sum specified
was due to him as his fee, with interest added,

out of it altogether. Left without counsel at the last
moment, Cagliostro was driven in desperation to defend
his cause himself. As his knowledge of English was
very imperfect, he was obliged to have an interpreter,
and, none other apparently being available, he employed
Vitellini. But as Vitellini, either owing to excitement
caused by the responsibility he was suddenly called
upon to assume, or to an equally imperfect knowledge
of English, could not make himself understood, Lord[Pg 65]Mansfield, to avoid further confusion, and perceiving
from the charge of witchcraft that the case was trivial,
suggested a compromise and recommended a Mr.

consent.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

he had obtained the sequins, Broad replied that he
had “bought them of a merchant whose name he
could not recollect.” At this Howarth, whose
suspicions were naturally aroused by such a reply,
observed that “it must have been a very large amount
of sequins to represent £200, and he did not believe
any merchant would have such a quantity on hand.”

this there was nothing for Howarth to do but dismiss
the charge, which he did with “a severe reprimand.”[Pg 66]Miss Fry, however, was not to be beaten without a
further effort. She demanded that the necklace should
be returned to her, which she declared she had onlylentto the Countess. To this Cagliostro saw fit to
protest, but as Vitellini failed to express his reasons
intelligibly, Howarth came to the conclusion that the
necklace at least belonged to Miss Fry. He therefore

to pay the costs and compensate Miss Fry, he resolved
to release himself from his obligations by surrendering
the Count. Keeping his intention a profound secret,
he paid a friendly visit to Cagliostro, and at the close
carried him off for a drive in the park. “On their way,”
says an anonymous author of the only contemporary
book in defence of Cagliostro, “they alighted at
a judge’s chambers, where Mr. Badioli said he had
business to settle. They then again entered the coach,

situation apathetically. More than a month elapsed
before he apparently took steps to procure his release—even
then the proceedings which resulted in his
liberation from the King’s Bench prison do not
appear to have been instituted by himself, but by a
certain O’Reilly. Now as this good Samaritan was
previously unknown to him, there is reason to suppose
that he was delegated by the Esperance Lodge of

protested “he had never seen Aylett, and did not
believe Aylett had ever seen him,” or that Aylett
himself did not appear in person. As the law then
stood, Crisp’s statement was sufficient to detain the
unfortunate Count, whom he in his turn was anxious[Pg 69]to bleed while he had the chance. Accordingly,
while admitting that without Aylett’s consent he
was not empowered to accept the bail which Cagliostro
eagerly offered him, Crisp was only ready to
let him go “if he could deposit in his hand thirty

redeem it the next day. His request was granted,

O’Reilly went to the Countess for the plate in
question, which consisted of “two soup-ladles, two

had freed the prisoner was highly exasperated and
demanded the plate, which had consequently been
given him. As Aylett, on the other hand, when

as he termed it, of which he was the victim the most
curious is undoubtedly the unexpected advent of
Aylett upon the scene in a rôle totally unconnected
with the development, so to speak, of the plot of
the play. Considering that he was the first person
on record to state that Cagliostro was Giuseppe[Pg 70]Balsamo, it is worth while inquiring into his reason

1046,CHAPTER I,"Aylett’s reputation, to begin with, was such as
to render the truth of any statement he might make
extremely doubtful, if not to invalidate it altogether.
Like Reynolds and Priddle, he was a rascally attorney
who had been “convicted of perjury and exposed
in the pillory.” Granting that he had defended
Balsamo in his action against Dr. Benamore, and
was sufficiently struck by the resemblance of
Cagliostro to his old client as to believe them to
be the same person, his conduct on the present
occasion was decidedly ambiguous. According to his
statement, “happening one day in 1777 to be in
Westminster Hall, he perceived a person that he
immediately recognized as Balsamo, whom he had
not seen since 1772.” Instead of accosting him then
and there, he decided to find out where he lived; and
after much difficulty learnt that the person he had seen
and believed to be Balsamo was in the King’s Bench
prison and that his name was Cagliostro; whereupon,without taking the least step to ascertain whether he
was right or not in his surmise, he laid a detainer
against him for the money Balsamo owed him. No
record of any kind exists as to what passed between
Aylett and Cagliostro when they finally met, or in fact
whether they met at all.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

Cagliostro’s plate or money from Crisp, have admitted
he had made a mistake is, judging from the man’s
character, not to be credited. But what renders this
singular matter still more questionable is the fact that
the Editor of theCourier de l’Europenine years later,[Pg 71]when publishing his “incontestable proofs” of the
identity of Balsamo with Cagliostro, should have
accepted the statement of Aylett andignoredthat of Dr. Benamore, who was also living at the
time and whose position as representative in England
for thirty years of the various Barbary States would,
to say the least, have given the weight of respectability
to his word. Now as there is no doubt at all

coeval with the creation of man. Vincent de Beauvais
was of the opinion that all the antediluvians must have
had some knowledge of alchemy, and cites Noah as
having been acquainted with theelixir vitae, “otherwise
he could not have lived to so prodigious an age
and begotten children when upwards of five hundred.”
Others have traced it to the Egyptians, from whom
Moses was believed to have learnt it. Martini, on the
other hand, affirms that alchemy was practised by
the Chinese two thousand five hundred years before
the birth of Christ. But though a belief in the transmutation
of metals was general in the Roman Empire,
the practice of alchemy does not appear to have
received much consideration before the eighth century.
At this period the discoveries of Gebir, an Arabian
alchemist, gave so great a stimulus to the quest of[Pg 79]the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life that he
is generally regarded as the creator of these picturesque
delusions, which for a thousand years had so great
a hold on the popular imagination.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1073,CHAPTER I,"Banned and fostered in turn, and often at the same
time, by the Church; practised in all classes of society
and by all sorts and conditions of people; regarded
with admiration and contempt; alchemy has played
too vast and important a rôle in the history of
humanity to be despised, wild and romantic though
this rôle has been. Nothing could be more unjust
and absurd than to judge it by the charlatans who
exploited it. The alchemists whom history still
remembers were in reality the pioneers of civilization,
who, venturing ahead of the race befogged in dense
forests of ignorance and superstition, cut a road
through to the light, along which mankind travelled
slowly in their wake. Not only were these fantastic
spirits of light the parents of modern science and
physics, but they have helped to adorn literature and
art. Some idea of their importance may be gathered
from the many words in common use that they have
given to the language, such as:crucible,amalgam,alcohol,potash,laudanum,precipitate,saturation,distillation,quintessence,affinity, etc.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1074,CHAPTER I,"The alchemists often stumbled upon discoveries
they did not seek. Science is thus indebted to Gebir
for the first suggestion of corrosive sublimate, the red
oxide of mercury, nitric acid, and nitrate of silver;
to Roger Bacon for the telescope, the magic lantern,
and gunpowder; to Van Helmont for the properties
of gas; to Paracelsus, the most extraordinary of them
all, for laudanum. It is to him also that medicine[Pg 80]owes the idea of the clinic. As in chemistry so in
other sciences the most important discoveries were
made by men who had a marked taste for alchemic

cabalistic considerations.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

to what was known as “magic” not to be confounded
with it. In the popular estimation the alchemists were
all magicians. Most, perhaps all, of the so-called
occult phenomena so familiar to us to-day were
performed by them. Long before such things as
animal magnetism, hypnotism, telepathy, ventriloquism,

element of magic in alchemy that prepared the way
for the great change that came over the science at
the beginning of the seventeenth century. With the
revival of learning that followed the Renaissance,
there arose a mysterious sect in Germany known as
the Rosicrucians, who were destined to revolutionize
the belief in the supernatural. They claimed to derive
their name from a certain Christian Rosencreutz who,
in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had been initiated
into the mysteries of the wisdom of the East. The
tenets of the Rosicrucians, as well as their existence,
were first made known to the world at the beginning
of the seventeenth century in an anonymous German
work said to have been found in the tomb of Rosencreutz,
who had died one hundred and twenty years
previously.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1079,CHAPTER I,"The absurd legends concerning him have led many
to deny that such a person as Rosencreutz ever
existed. Such writers attribute the origin of the
society to the theories of Paracelsus and Dr. Dee,
who unconsciously became the real though unrecognized
founders of the Rosicrucians. Be this as it may,
no sooner were their doctrines generally known than
all the alchemists and believers in the marvellous
hastened to accept them. The influence thus acquired
by the “Society of the Rose-Cross” was as beneficial
as it was far-reaching. Its character was a sort of
Protestant mysticism, and its chief aim the gratuitous
healing of the sick. Hitherto alchemy and the belief
in the supernatural had been grossly materialistic.
The Rosicrucians refined the one and spiritualized the
other. They claimed that by strictly conforming to[Pg 82]the rules of their philosophy, of which chastity was
the most rigorous and important, they could ignore
hunger or thirst, enjoy perfect health, and prolong
their lives indefinitely. Of the occult knowledge they
possessed, that of transmuting metals into gold was
stripped of its old significance. The philosopher’s
stone was no longer to be regarded as merely the
means of acquiring riches, but the instrument by which
mankind could command the service of the spirits of
the invisible world.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

terrifying demons with which the monks had peopled
the unseen, but mild, beautiful, and beneficent sprites,
anxious to be of service to men. In the Rosicrucian
imagination there existed in each element a race of
spirits peculiar to it. Thus the air was inhabited by
Sylphs, the water by Undines, the earth by Gnomes,
and the fire by Salamanders. It was by them that all
that was marvellous was done. In the course of their
development the mystical tendencies of the Rosicrucians
became more and more pronounced. Thus
they finally came to regard the philosopher’s stone as
signifying contentment, the secret of which was compared
in the mystical phraseology they adopted to
“a spirit that lived within an emerald and converted
everything near it to the highest perfection it was
capable of.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

effected without interruption. Towards the beginning[Pg 83]of the eighteenth century the bridge, undermined by

it was necessary to make a powerful appeal to the

producing effect as supernatural ones, the world was
startled by a series of miracles performed at the grave
of Deacon Pâris, a famous martyr in the cause of
Jansenism. These miracles, which at first took the
form of cures such as at the present day are to be
seen at Lourdes, soon acquired fame. All sorts of
people, whom the doctors were unable to restore to
health, began to flock to the Jansenist Cemetery of St.
Médard, where it was discovered that other graves
beside that of Deacon Pâris, and finally the whole
cemetery shared the healing properties of his ashes.
The hitherto simple character of the cures was
changed. They were accompanied by extraordinary

to the provinces which, jealous of Paris, determined to

Similar scenes to those at St. Médard were enacted in

yearned to be born. To assist at thisaccouchementwas the aim of all the philosophical midwifery of the

displayed the same predatory and brutal instincts as
the intolerant religion in whose iron carapace it

punishment that brute authority awarded those who

the philosophers were reinforced by sovereigns imbued

To them as well as to their princely disciples
“to free God” was another name for religious

Encyclopedists worked, and which Frederick the Great
and the sovereigns who shared his enlightened opinions
desired. Nothing was further from their intention
than that it should take the form in which it eventually
came. It is impossible to believe that the Revolution
which demanded the heads of a Lavoisier and a
Bailly would have spared those of a Voltaire or a[Pg 98]Rousseau. Least of all would the stupid mob that
watched the victims doomed to the guillotine “spit

occultism had waited. It alone had a clear and

Saint-Martin endeavoured to detach himself and his
adherents from the magic in which Pasqualis—who
practised it openly—had involved this sect. But
though he gave up the quest of supernatural
phenomena as unnecessary to an acquaintance with
the unseen, and wandered deeper and deeper into
pure mysticism, he never wholly succeeded in escaping
from the grosser influence of his first initiation in the
occult. From the fact, however, that he called himself
the “Robinson Crusoe of spiritualism,” some idea
may be gained of the distance that separated him
from those who also claimed connection with the
invisible world. He did not count on being understood.
Of one of his books he said, “it is too far
from ordinary human ideas to be successful. I have[Pg 102]often felt in writing it as if I were playing valses on

therefore for the Illuminés as easy as it was natural.
Lodges of Illuminism were founded all over Germany.
The number and variety of sects, however, that had
found an asylum in Freemasonry by the diversity of
their aims tended to weaken rather than strengthen
the association. At length, the discovery that
impostors, like Schröpfer, Rosicrucians and even
Jesuits had founded lodges led to a general council
of Freemasons for the purpose of giving the society
the homogeneity it lacked. With this object a
convention of Masons was held at Wilhelmsbad in
1782 to which deputies were sent from all parts of
Europe. Knigge and Weishaupt attended and, perceiving
the vast possibilities of the consolidation of
the sects, they endeavoured to capture the whole

Moreover, if Cagliostro and Balsamo are the same,

the inquisitive stranger, who with the characteristic
superstition of the century at once jumped to the
conclusion that he was in the presence of the chief of
one of the secret societies attached to Freemasonry
who, fleeing from persecution, was obliged to conceal
his identity. Accordingly, with a sentimental benevolence—from
which it may be inferred he was both a

alone appears to have neither recognized nor appreciated.
Their union was of short duration: after six
years of wedlock the Countess von der Recke, who
had married at seventeen to please her father, obtained
a divorce. She was amply compensated for what she
had suffered by the affection she obtained from her

matters, and regarded her always as her dearest friend.[Pg 128]But it was to her young brother to whom she was
most deeply attached. Nor was he less devoted to
her. Nearly of the same age, and possessing the

They differed only in one respect. Equally serious
and reflective, each longed to solve the “problems of

was led to seek their solution in the Bible, in the gospel

gifts. While others conversed with him on magic and
necromancy, which she regarded as “devilish,” she
talked of the “union of the physical and spiritual[Pg 132]worlds, the power of prayer, and the miracles of the
early Christians.” She told him how the death of
her brother had robbed her life of happiness, and that
in the hope of seeing him once more she had often spent

at night. And she also gave the Grand Cophta to

That the thoughts of others besides himself should be

its expectation. With an air of great mystery, which
Cagliostro could make so impressive, he delivered to

them to be directly inspired by the powers of darkness.
At first, in her admiration of Cagliostro, she prayed
that he might escape temptation and be preserved

her he was surrounded. When at last he declared
that he was informed by the ever-attendant Hanachiel[Pg 139]that the demon who guarded the buried treasure was
not to be propitiated without much difficulty and

these lectures that he unconsciously lost the respect
of the Countess he strove so hard to preserve. One
day, while expatiating on the times when the sons
of God loved the daughters of men, as described in
the Bible—which, he predicted, would return when
mankind was morally regenerate—carried away by his

He had burnt it, he said, ‘to test the theory of

after the events it relates. It is from a letter written
by Laborde, the Farmer-General, who happened to be

societies of Germany. This society has always been[Pg 156]assumedto be the Illuminés.[18]If this assumption be
true—and without it his mode of life in Strasburg is
utterly inexplicable—his initiation could only have
taken place at this period and, probably, at Frankfort,
where Knigge, one of the leaders of the Illuminés, had
his head-quarters.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

Observance, in the lodges of which throughout Germany
Cagliostro’s reputation as a wonder-worker stood
high, he had undoubtedly heard of him, if he was not
personally acquainted with him. Knigge, moreover,
was just the man to appreciate the possibilities of such
a reputation in obtaining recruits for Illuminism.
Nothing is more reasonable, then, than to assume that
certain members of the Illuminés made overtures at
Frankfort to Cagliostro, who, one can imagine, would
have readily accepted them as the means of recovering

took place in a grotto a short distance from
the city. In the centre, on a table, was an iron chest,
from which Knigge or his deputy took a manuscript.
On the first page Cagliostro perceived the words “We,
the Grand Masters of the Templars.” Then followed
the formula of an oath written in blood, to which
eleven signatures were appended, and which signified
that Illuminism was a conspiracy against thrones. The
first blow was to be struck in France, and, after the[Pg 157]fall of the monarchy, Rome was to be attacked.

Alsace, it is certain that great pains had been taken in
advance to excite public interest in him. The fabulous
Palladium could not have been welcomed with greater
demonstrations of joy. From early morning crowds of
people waited on the Pont de Kœhl and on both banks
of the Rhine for the arrival of a mysterious personage
who was reported to go from city to city healing the
sick, working miracles, and distributing alms. In the
crowd speculations were rife as to his mysterious origin,
his mysterious travels in strange and remote countries,
and of the mysterious source of his immense wealth.
Some regarded him as one inspired, a saint or a
prophet possessed of the gift of miracles. To others,
the cures attributed to him were the natural result of
his great learning and occult powers. Yet another
group saw in him an evil genius, a devil sent into the
world on some diabolic mission. Among these, however—and[Pg 158]they were not the least numerous—there
were some more favourable to Cagliostro, and who,

“hair in a net,” and wearing a blue coat covered with
gold braid and precious stones. Bizarre though he was

turned was not to be neglected. Fond of luxury and
aristocratic society though he was, Cagliostro was
not the man to despise popularity in any form that it
presented itself. Having lost the influence of the
great, by means of whom he had counted to establish
Egyptian Masonry, he was anxious to secure that of
the masses. So great was the importance he attached
to the interest he had aroused, he even took up his[Pg 159]abode among them, “living first over a retail tobacconist’s
named Quère, whose shop was in one of the
most squalid quarters of the town, and later lodging

No one, providing he was poor and unfortunate,
appealed to him in vain. Hearing that an
Italian was in prison for a debt of two hundred livres,
Cagliostro obtained his release by paying the money
for him, and clothed him into the bargain. Baron von

Cagliostro. If a rich invalid desired his attendance he
referred him to the regular doctors. Though such an
attitude was well calculated to attract attention, it was
not, as his enemies have declared, altogether prompted
by selfish considerations. In the disdain he affected
for the rich there was much real resentment. Through
the rich and powerful, he had gained nothing but mortification
and disgrace. The circumstances under which
he was forced to flee from Warsaw must have wounded
to the quick a nature in which inordinate vanity and
generosity were so curiously blended. Of a certainty
it was not alone the hope of turning Illuminism to the
advantage of Egyptian Masonry that prompted him
to join the Illuminés in his hour of humiliation. In
Illuminism, whose aim, revolutionary though it was,
like that of Egyptian Masonry, was also inspired with
the love of humanity, Cagliostro had seen both a[Pg 161]means of rehabilitation and revenge. Of studied vengeance,
however, he was incapable; the disdain with
which he treated the rich was the extent of his revenge.
Indeed, susceptible as he was to flattery, it was not
long before his resentment was altogether appeased.
But though, in spite of his bitter experience, he was
even once more tempted to court the favour of the
great, he did so in quite a different manner. Henceforth,
in pandering to their love of sensation, he took

The old popular belief in medicinal stones and magical
herbs was still prevalent. One writer of the period
pretended to know that Cagliostro’s “Elixir Vitæ”
was composed of “magical herbs and gold in solution.”
Another declared it to be the same as the elixir of
Arnauld de Villeneuve, a famous alchemist of the
Middle Ages, whose prescription consisted of “a mixture

the case against Cagliostro rests is that of manufacturing
his remedies with the object of defrauding the public

affluence, giving much to the needy, and seeking
no favours whatever from the rich.” In Strasburg,

his annual expenditure was not less than 20,000
livres.” In Paris he was reputed to live at the rate of
100,000 livres a year. The splendid footing on which
his establishment was maintained was, however,

admiring band of street-arabs says “he was wearing a
coat of blue silk braided along the seams; his hair in
powdered knots was gathered up in a net; his shoesà la d’Artoiswere fastened with jewelled buckles, his
stockings studded with gold buttons; rubies and
diamonds sparkled on his fingers, and on the frill of
his shirt; from his watch-chain hung a diamond drop,
a gold key adorned with diamonds, and an agate seal—all

1499,CHAPTER I,"The Marquise de Créquy, Beugnot, and nearly all
his contemporaries allude to the fantastic manner in
which he dressed as well as to his colossal vanity,
which, inflated by success, rendered him not only
ridiculous to those whom he failed to fascinate, but
even insufferable. Pompous in Mittau, he became
arrogant, domineering, and choleric in Paris. Flattery,[Pg 211]to which he had always been peculiarly susceptible,
at last became to him like some drug by which he
was enslaved. He could not tolerate criticism or
contradiction. “The Chevalier de Montbruel,” says
Beugnot, “a veteran of the green-room, and ready to
affirm anything, was always at hand to bear witness to

success, never so compromised by the tricks and
devices to which he stooped to perform his wonders,
as to lose sight of his ideal. Had he been the vulgar
cheat, the sordid impostor it is customary to depict him,
he would have contented himself with the subscriptions
paid by the members of the lodges he founded
and have ceased to insist on the ethical character
of Egyptian Masonry. In 1785 a religious element
was calculated to repel rather than to attract. It was
the wonder-man, and not the idealist, in whom Paris
was interested. But instead of taking the line of least
resistance, so to speak, Cagliostro deliberately adopted
a course that could not fail to make enemies rather
than friends.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

of the Egyptian Rite, he laid greater stress on it than
ever, and claimed for his sect a superiority over all the
others of Freemasonry, on the ground that it was
based on the mysteries of Isis and Anubis which he
had brought from the East. As no one ever ventured
to regard him as a fool as well as a knave, it is impossible
to question his sincerity in the matter. At once
the seventy-two Masonic lodges of Paris rose in arms[Pg 212]against him. He managed, however, to triumph over
all opposition. At a meeting held for the purpose of
expounding the dogmas of Egyptian Masonry “his
eloquence was so persuasive,” says Figuier, “that he

Savalette de Langes, a revolutionary mystic, sought
to finish in France the work which Weishaupt had
begun in Germany. As an old Illuminé, Savalette de
Langes was well acquainted with Cagliostro, and the
importance he attached to him was so great that he
desired to incorporate the sect of Egyptian Masonry
in that of the Philalètes. He accordingly summoned
a congress of Philalètes to which Cagliostro was invited

Cophta had kept pace with the steadily rising fortunes
of Egyptian Masonry. He was quick to perceive the
immense advantage to be derived from a union of the
organization of which he was the head with that of the
Philalètes, who were one of the most numerous and influential
of the Masonic sects. But he had no intention
of playing second fiddle to them, and in replying[Pg 213]to their invitation he assumed that they were prepared
to acknowledge the superiority of the Egyptian Rite.
So with pompous condescension, which was as astute as
it was bizarre, he informed them that “having deigned
to extend to them his hand and consented to cast a
ray of light upon the darkness of their Temple, he
requested them as a sign of their submission to the
truths of Egyptian Masonry to burn their archives.”",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

did not abandon the hope of coming to some
satisfactory arrangement. But Cagliostro proved too
clever for them, and in the series of interviews and
negotiations which followed they were completely overawed
and over-reached. For a moment it seemed as
if Freemasonry in general was to be restored to “its
original Egyptian character,” and that Cagliostro would
realize his sublime ideal, perform the greatest of all

on his former ancestral estate. He eventually died in

founded by Madame de Pompadour. Madame de

the highway. It was in this condition that she first
attracted the attention of the Marquise de Boulainvilliers,

wrong man. Lamotte was good-looking, of a
respectable family, and crippled with debt. Unable

the right person to take up her cause to triumph in the

Cardinal de Rohan. His Eminence, who was both[Pg 216]sympathetic and susceptible, manifested the greatest
pity for the young and charming Countess whose
condition was in such a contrast to her illustrious birth.

genius for intrigue urged her to exploit.[28]By
circulating rumours of her friendship with the Queen,
to which her frequent journeys to Versailles in search
of some influential person to present her petition to
the King gave weight, she had obtained credit from
tradespeople. To cause this rumour to glide to the
ears of his Eminence was easy. And as people
generally believe what flatters them, when Madame

between Marie Antoinette and Rohan. This correspondence
of which the Queen, needless to say, had
not the least inkling, becoming as it proceeded less
and less cold and reserved, inflamed all the desires that
fermented in the heart of the Cardinal. In this way it

that Cagliostro inspired was shared only by his followers—of
whom, however, he could count several thousands,
it is said, in Paris. On the other hand, the curiosity
which he had excited was general and anything but
reverent. The exaggerated enthusiasm of his followers,
the incredible stories related of him, and the
extreme seriousness with which he took himself made
him ridiculous. If he was the chief subject of conversation
in all classes in Paris, it was as a subject of
mirth. In the drama of the Necklace Affair it was to
him that the public looked to supply the comic relief.
He was by common consent the clown, the funny man
of the play, so to speak. He had but to appear on
the scene to raise a laugh, his slightest gesture produced
a roar, when he spoke he convulsed the house.[Pg 230]But to Cagliostro his rôle was very far from comic.
The consciousness of innocence is not necessarily a
consolation in adversity. It poisons as often as it
stimulates—according to the temperament. Cagliostro
was utterly crushed by the blow that had fallen on
him. The gloom of the Bastille, which the popular
imagination haunted by old legends made deeper than
it was, seemed to chill his very soul. He who had
faced with “a front of brass” all the previous dangers
and humiliations of his agitated existence was for the
first time cowed. Illuminist, Egyptian Mason, Mystic
Regenerator of Mankind—Revolutionist, in a word—he
had no confidence in the justice of the power into

had carried off her husband, Chesnon and the police,
who had remained behind after searching for incriminating
documents which they did not find, attached
seals to the house and carried her off too, “half dead

Cagliostro could not write, a friend was supposed to
write the letters for her. In the same way if he

accused of another’s crime; arrested with the utmost
brutality and treated with outrageous severity; kept
in uncertainty of the fate of his wife, who for six
months, unknown to him, was confined within fifteen
feet of him; he had been an object of ridicule and
mockery within, of calumny and detraction without his

Queen—the low and contemptible revenge of low and

Directed against Breteuil, whose unpopularity, already
great, it increased, it assailed more or less openly the
monarchical principle itself. Of all the pamphlets
which from the Necklace Affair to the fall of the
Bastille attacked the royal authority none are so
dignified or so eloquent. The longing for freedom,
which was latent in the bosom of every man and
which the philosophers and the secret societies had
been doing their best to fan into a flame, was revealed
in every line. It was not unreasonably regarded as
the confession of faith of an Illuminé. The Inquisition-biographer
declares that it was conceived in a spirit so
calculated to excite a revolt that “it was with difficulty
a printer could be found in England to print it.”[Pg 255]Cagliostro himself admits that it was written with “a

pride, the pride of an aristocrat—he was the personification
of reaction—would have scorned to notice the
insult of one so far beneath him as Cagliostro. But
the prestige of the Government and the majesty of the

but one way to prevent this contingency—to kidnap him.

that Barthélemy intended to forcibly detain him when
he called, but rather to gull him by false pretences—a
not difficult proceeding in the case of one so notoriously

had no more fear of a libel than Voltaire, would have

the manner in which they had lived, their forgeries,
blackmail, poverty, licentiousness, imprisonment—everything,
in fact, that could damage Cagliostro andhiswife. He found people, moreover, to swear to the
truth of all he said, or rather he asserted it, and on the
strength of their accusations caused Cagliostro to be
sued for debts incurred in the name of Balsamo years
before. He collected all the hostile reports of the

who happened to be in England, the wonder-worker
published aLetter to the English People, in which he
flung in the face of the blackmailer all the atrocious acts
of his own past. Morande, however, aware that any
effort on his part to clear himself of these accusations
would be useless, sought to distract attention from the
subject by daring Cagliostro to disprove the charges
made in theCourier. At the same time he thought to
stab him to silence by covering with ridicule a statement

effect that “the lions and tigers in the forests of

healthy, and I will not come near it till it is served on

chosen the portion that you prefer, you shall give me
what you think proper. The next day one of four
things will occur: either we shall both be dead, or we
shall neither of us be dead; or I shall be dead and
you will not; or you will be dead and I shall not. Of

guest would only very imperfectly represent you.
Where would you find a carnivorous animal which
amongst its own species is what you are amongst
men? It is not your representative, but yourself, with
whom I wish to treat. The custom of combat by
champions has long gone out of fashion, and even if I
allowed you to restore it, honour would forbid me to
contend with the champion you offer. A champion
should not have to be dragged into the arena, but
enter it willingly; and however little you may know

side. The public, moreover, were beginning to detect
the mercenary hireling in the detractor, and as the
gallery had ceased to be amused Morande, to avoid

Cagliostro, he had received a mortal wound. The
poisoned pigs of the Arabians were not more destructive
than the poisoned pen of Theveneau de Morande. The
persistency of his attacks, the ingenuity of his detraction,
were more effective than the most irrefutable
proof. His articles, in spite of their too evident[Pg 270]hostility, their contradictions, their statements either
unverifiable or based on the testimony of persons
whose reputations alone made it worthless, created a
general feeling that the man whom they denounced
was an impostor. The importance of the paper in
which they appeared, quoted by other papers, all of
Europe, served to confirm this impression. Thus the
world, whose conclusions are formed by instinct rather
than reason, forgetting that it had ridiculed as improbable
Cagliostro’s own story of his life, accepted the
amazing and still more improbable past that Morande
“unmasked” without reservation. Nor did the Court
of Versailles and its friends, nor all the forces of
law and order which, threatened everywhere, made
common cause with the threatened French monarchy,
fail to circulate and confirm by every means in their
power the statements of Morande. As if the stigma

adopted methods less likely to scandalize the British

Rite. It was undoubtedly with this object in view
that he inserted a notice in theMorning Heraldin
which he invited “all true Masons in the name of

and whose testimony is above dispute, Swinton was
every bit as unprincipled as his editor. A Scotchman
by birth, he had lived the greater part of his life,
married, and made his fortune in France. On settling
in London he had drifted naturally into the French
colony, in which, by reason of his sympathies, connections
and interests he had acquired great influence,
which he turned to account on every possible occasion.
One of his many profitable enterprises was a “home”
for young Frenchmen employed in London. “He also
ran a druggist’s shop,” says Brissot, “in the name of
one of his clerks, and a restaurant in the name of
another.”[43]And when Cagliostro arrived in London
with a letter of introduction to him, Swinton, who was
as full of schemes as he was devoid of principle,
thought to run him, too, for his own profit. The[Pg 274]wonder-worker with his elixirs, his balsams, and his
magical phenomena was, if properly handled, a mine

language and customs of the country in which he had
sought refuge, Swinton, who was assiduous in his
attentions, rented him a house in Sloane Street, for
which he desired a tenant, induced him to pay the cost
of repairing it, and provided him with the furniture he
needed at double its value. To prevent any one else
from interfering with the agreeable task of plucking so
fat a bird, and at the same time the better to conceal
his duplicity, Swinton endeavoured to preclude all
approach to his prey. It was to this end that he made
trouble between Cagliostro and O’Reilly. Having
succeeded thus far in his design he redoubled his
attentions, and urged Cagliostro to give a public
exhibition of his healing powers, as he had done at
Strasburg. But warned by previous experience of the
danger of exciting afresh the hostility of the doctors,
Cagliostro firmly refused. Swinton then proposed to
become his apothecary, and to push the sale of the
Grand Cophta’s various medicaments, of which his
druggist’s shop should have the monopoly, in theCourier de l’Europe.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,

apparently, not to disclose the secret of their
preparation—if not to share with the apothecary, as
Morande afterwards declared, the exorbitant profit to
be derived from their sale. Perceiving that he was
not to be persuaded by fair means, Swinton injudiciously
tried to put on the screw. But his threats,
far from accomplishing their purpose, only served to[Pg 275]betray his designs, and so disgusted Cagliostro that
he ceased to have any further communication with
him. Swinton, however, was not to be got rid of in
any such fashion. Living next door to his enemy, his
house became the rendezvous of the various bailiffs

unfortunate adversary.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1701,CHAPTER I,"Among numerous schemes of Swinton and Morande
to capture Cagliostro were two attempts to obtain his
arrest by inducing persons to take out writs against
him for imaginary debts—a proceeding which the
custom of merely swearing to a debt to procure a writ
rendered easy. In this way Priddle, who had behaved
so scurvily in Cagliostro’s arbitration suit with Miss
Fry in 1777, was induced to take out a writ for sixty
pounds, due, as he pretended, for legal business transacted
nine years before. Warned, however, that the
bailiffs were hiding in Swinton’s house to serve the writ
the moment he should appear, Cagliostro was able to
defeat their intention by procuring bail before they
could accomplish their purpose. In the end it was
Priddle who went to Newgate. But instead of the
former demand for sixty pounds, Cagliostro, by means
of one of the various legal subterfuges in the practice
of which the eighteenth century lawyer excelled, was
obliged to pay one hundred and eighty pounds and
costs.",,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74618/pg74618-images.html,,CAGLIOSTRO,
1702,CHAPTER I,"Immediately after this dearly-bought victory, the
baited victim of ministerial tyranny and corruption was
similarly attacked from another quarter in a manner

a libellous pamphlet against Cagliostro—quoted by[Pg 276]Madame de Lamotte at her trial, when it was generally
regarded as worthless, and its suppression ordered by
the Parliament of Paris—appeared in London and
obtained a writ for one hundred and fifty pounds,
which, he claimed, Cagliostro owed him for the week
passed in his service in Strasburg in 1781. The
impudence of this claim on examination was, of course,
sufficient to disprove it; but Morande, who had
brought Sacchi to England and assisted him to procure
the writ, all but succeeded in having Cagliostro ignominiously
dragged to Newgate on the strength of it.
The proximity, however, of Swinton’s house—in which

held séances which many people of distinction attended.

run to a “temple” as at Lyons, but the room in which
the faithful met was arranged to resemble as closely as[Pg 284]possible the interior of that edifice. Both sexes were

to bay at Trent. His courage was completely broken.
Spent in this struggle against destiny, he was no
longer able to devise new schemes and contrivances

of healing. The Inquisition-biographer cites several
instances of his failure to effect the cures he attempted

alone were granted him, for the Inquisition had no
desire to have him die before they had finished trying

concerned for the health of his soul, when to the above

his liberty by this means he was mistaken.” Perceiving
that this act of repentance, far from being of

One day he would acknowledge that Egyptian Masonry
was a huge system of imposture which had as its object
the destruction of throne and altar. The next he

by the Papal government as a proof of its determination
to show no quarter in its war against
the Freemasons may be gathered from the Inquisition-biographer’sVie de Joseph Balsamo, which is less a
life of Balsamo or Cagliostro, as it purports to be, than
a furious attack on Freemasonry, which is depicted in
the blackest and most odious colours. Its publication
exasperated the secret societies in Lombardy and they
were emboldened by the progress of the Revolution
to publish a reply. “This pamphlet,” says theMoniteur, “appeared under the auspices of the Swiss
government and produced such a sensation throughout
Italy, and particularly in Rome, that the Conclave,

awaiting the Roman populace to march on St. Angelo

that in a terrific storm “in which Rome was stricken

Capucin was sent him. After his confession, Cagliostro
entreated the priest to give him the ‘discipline’ with
the cord he wore as a belt, to which the latter willingly[Pg 304]consented. But scarcely had he received the first blow
when he seized the cord, flung himself on the Capucin,
and did his best to strangle him. His intention was
to escape in the priest’s cloak, and had he been in his
vigour and his opponent a weak man he might have

liberty, Cagliostro was secretly sent “in the middle of
the night” to the Castle of San Leo, near Montefeltro.
The situation of this stronghold is one of the most
singular in Europe. The enormous rock, whose summit
it crowns, rising on three sides precipitously from an
almost desert plain, is like a monument commemorative
of some primeval convulsion of nature. In early times
it had been the site of a temple of Jupiter, the ruins
of which after its destruction by the barbarians became
the abode of a Christian hermit, whose ascetic virtues
were canonized, and who bequeathed his name to it.
In the Middle Ages the holy ruins gave place to an
almost impregnable fortress, which at a still later

of sedition or heretical doctrines, should find there an

imprisonment, the Holy Tribunal took care that the
commutation should be equivalent to the death penalty.
His only communication with mankind was when his
jailers raised the trap to let food down to him. Here
he languished for three years without air, movement,
or intercourse with his fellow-creatures. During the
